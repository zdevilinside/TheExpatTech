Moving to Mexico was a rushed endeavor for us. We were heading south in a used minivan we bought specifically for the move. You can’t rent a U‑Haul to cross international borders, so the van seemed like the simplest solution. It was cheap, and the plan was to get rid of it once we arrived in Mexico. That turned out not to be possible.  

To say we were unprepared is the understatement of the century. We based our expectations on what we knew from living in the United States and from a couple of short trips to Puerto Peñasco, Mexico (better known as Rocky Point). My girlfriend at the time jokingly called it “Pina Colada” because she was drunk during one of those trips. Needless to say, reality was very different.

## The Journey Begins

We left Albuquerque, NM, headed for my parents’ house in Las Cruces. Along the way, the dreaded **“check engine” light** came on. With little mechanical knowledge, we feared the worst and thought we’d have to unload everything into another vehicle.  

Thankfully, my brother reassured us. He showed us his own Ford Escape’s check engine light and explained it wasn’t always catastrophic. A quick trip to AutoZone revealed the issue was just an O2 sensor. Relieved, we reloaded the van and left the car at my parents’ house for later retrieval.  

Because of delays, we didn’t leave Las Cruces until 7 p.m. The plan was to drive until we were tired and then find a place to sleep. Destination: Laredo, TX.

## Floods, Detours, and Deer

On the way, we were detoured around a section of I‑10 that was so badly flooded cars were stranded in the water. At Fort Stockton, TX, we stopped for gas and turned toward Sanderson. Angel and I decided to keep driving since we weren’t tired yet. Another mistake.  

As we left Fort Stockton, deer began appearing everywhere along the roadside. Their glowing eyes and flapping ears were constant hazards. I counted at least **100 deer** between Fort Stockton and Sanderson. Angel wanted to sleep, but I needed her awake to help spot them.  

Exhaustion set in, so I pulled into a roadside picnic area. Imagine trying to sleep upright in a driver’s seat crammed with belongings, five cats meowing nonstop, and my wife snoring beside me. Every time I started to nod off, a semi roared past, shaking the van. Sleep was impossible.

## Sanderson Struggles

We reached Sanderson only to find everything closed—even the Stripes convenience store. We parked between semis hoping to rest, but their idling engines made sleep impossible. With no hotel vacancies, we pressed on to Del Rio.  

The drive was grueling: more deer, more Border Patrol trucks with blinding high beams. Every mile was a battle between avoiding wildlife and enduring the glare of headlights.  

Finally, at 3:30 a.m., we arrived in Del Rio. The Motel 6 had vacancies. Too exhausted to care, we carried the cat carriers inside without mentioning them to the staff. At last, we collapsed into bed.  

The adventure would continue the next day…

## ✨ Did You Know? Moving to Mexico Quirks

- 🚚 **No U‑Haul Across Borders**  
  Rental companies prohibit international moves, forcing many expats to buy or borrow vehicles.  

- 🦌 **Texas Deer Hazards**  
  West Texas highways are notorious for deer collisions, especially at night.  

- 🛂 **Border Patrol Presence**  
  Near the border, trucks and checkpoints are common, often with high beams left on for visibility.  

- 🐱 **Pets Add Complexity**  
  Moving with animals requires extra planning—many hotels have strict pet policies.  

- 🌙 **Night Driving Risks**  
  Fatigue, wildlife, and limited services make overnight drives in rural Texas especially dangerous.

## Reflection

Day 1 of our move was chaotic, exhausting, and full of mistakes. Yet it set the tone for what living abroad often means: adapting to challenges, learning on the fly, and laughing at missteps later. What felt like disaster at the time became part of the story of how we built a new life in Mexico.

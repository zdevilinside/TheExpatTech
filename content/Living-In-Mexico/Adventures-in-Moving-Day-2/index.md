description: "Misadventures in Moving - Day 2"
---

We woke up late the next morning—closer to 11 a.m. than the 9 a.m. departure we had planned. Exhaustion had caught up with us. I quietly snuck the cats back into the van, and we set off once more.

## The AC Fiasco

As we pulled away, I realized the air conditioner wasn’t blowing cold. I had just put freon in the system before leaving Albuquerque! Back in the Motel 6 parking lot, I popped the hood and discovered my mistake: I had forgotten to replace the cap on the line, so all the freon had leaked out overnight. A rookie error.  

After topping it off again and grabbing food, we resumed the journey toward Laredo, aiming to cross into Mexico at **Colombia Crossing**. Five cats meowed nonstop in the back, adding to the chaos.

## Paperwork and Circles

At the border, I went inside to complete the paperwork: FMM tourist cards and a Temporary Import Permit for the van. Angel stayed outside, circling the parking lot in the van to keep the AC running for the cats. Once my paperwork was finished, she went in to get her FMM. Finally, we thought we were ready.  

But as we approached the crossing, the dreaded **red light** flashed—meaning further inspection.

## Customs Comedy

The customs agents inspected the van. From the side doors, everything looked fine. But when I opened the back, items tumbled out. The officer laughed as I tried to shove them back in with my rear end, leaving a dent in the door.  

Next came the x‑ray inspection. Confused by instructions, I drove to the wrong spot, then backtracked as agents waved me toward the scanning area. We were told to remove the animals before the van was scanned. Frustrated and tired, I hauled all five cats in a giant playpen carrier. Angel, the border patrol agent, and others laughed at the circus we created. I couldn’t blame them.  

At last, we were cleared. **We were officially in Mexico.**

## The Pothole Problem

Driving in Mexico quickly taught me a lesson: when semis move onto the shoulder, it often signals hazards ahead. I didn’t know this yet. We hit a massive pothole. The right front tire lost half its air.  

I debated: unload the van to reach the spare, or limp along until finding a service station. I chose the latter. Locals kept pulling up, pointing at the tire. No gas stations appeared. Frustration mounted.  

Finally, I pulled over—and by sheer luck, I had stopped at a roadside tire shop, though there were no signs to indicate it.

## The $2 Miracle

The mechanic aired up the tire, but a loud hiss revealed a dented rim. Smiling, he jacked up the van, removed the tire, hammered the rim flat with a block of wood, and reinflated it. It held at about 80%. Good enough.  

When I asked what I owed, he waved me off. Insisting, I followed him inside. He grabbed a Coke, gestured for me to take a water, and charged me only for the drinks. **Total cost: about $2.**  

Angel was stunned when I told her. We were back on the road, grateful for Mexican hospitality.

## Monterrey Maze

We continued down the **cuota** (Mexico’s toll roads) toward Monterrey. I wanted to bypass the city and head toward Saltillo but forgot to tell Angel. She panicked, thinking we were lost, and we argued. After two hours of circling Monterrey, we finally found a hotel.  

At check‑in, we watched two couples leave after balking at the price. We were too exhausted to care. We paid, carried the cats inside, and collapsed.  

The adventure would continue the next day…

## ✨ Did You Know? Moving to Mexico Insights

- 🛂 **Colombia Crossing**  
  This border crossing near Laredo is quieter than the main bridge but still requires full paperwork: FMM tourist cards and Temporary Import Permits.  

- 🚛 **Red Light/Green Light System**  
  Mexican customs uses a random traffic‑light system: green means go, red means inspection.  

- 🛠️ **Roadside Tire Shops**  
  In Mexico, many mechanics operate informally without signage. Locals know where they are, but travelers often stumble upon them by chance.  

- 🐱 **Traveling with Pets**  
  Bringing animals across the border adds complexity. Officially, paperwork is required, but enforcement varies.  

- 🛣️ **Cuota vs. Libre**  
  Mexico’s toll roads (cuotas) are faster and safer than free roads (libres), but they can be expensive.

## Reflection

Day 2 was a mix of frustration, comedy, and unexpected kindness. From leaking freon to dented rims, every setback tested our patience. Yet the generosity of a roadside mechanic reminded us that even in chaos, help can appear when you least expect it. These misadventures weren’t just obstacles—they were lessons in resilience and adaptation, shaping the journey that would eventually make Mexico our home.

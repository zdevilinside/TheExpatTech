I got in my van and drove there! ;)  

Okay, seriously. I really didn’t have much of a choice. In my case, I had just returned from a failed attempt to start school in Germany. We were in a tough spot—we had already sold our house, needed somewhere to live for six months, and had to survive on a student’s budget. The place had to be inexpensive, have reliable internet, and be near a major international airport.

## Searching for Options

I went online and started looking at places that fit those criteria. I joined the **Expats in Mexico** group on Facebook and asked questions, while also checking other expat forums around the world. One comment caught my attention: **Peo Lekare** posted a Speedtest result from his ISP in Cuernavaca, Mexico. It was faster than what I had in Albuquerque, NM.  

Curious, I messaged him for more information. He explained the costs of living, proximity to Mexico City, and other details. Over time, Peo convinced us that Cuernavaca was the best option.

## House Hunters, Cuernavaca Edition

Peo, his wife Fabiola, and their children went above and beyond to help us. They acted like our own “House Hunters International” crew—visiting properties, recording videos, and sharing impressions. Eventually, we found a place we liked.  

But just ten days before the move, the owner threw in a wrench: he demanded the **title to our vehicle** as a rental deposit. That was illegal in Mexico, but he didn’t care. We backed out immediately.

## A Last-Minute Save

Peo and his family scrambled to help us find another place. They succeeded, but the new owner wanted money **immediately** to hold the property. Against our better judgment, we wired the funds to Peo, who paid the deposit and first month’s rent for us. We were now eight days away from moving to Cuernavaca.  

Two days later, Peo messaged me: he had accepted a new job in Playa del Carmen and needed to move right away. Angel and I panicked. Had we just been scammed? We had already committed, so there was no turning back. We decided to push forward and deal with whatever came next.

## Reflection

My move to Mexico wasn’t carefully planned—it was born out of necessity, trust, and a bit of chaos. From failed schooling in Germany to last‑minute housing drama, the journey was full of uncertainty. Yet, with the help of friends and sheer determination, we made it.  

Looking back, the missteps and near‑scams were part of the adventure. Moving abroad isn’t easy, but it’s often the challenges that shape the story and make the destination feel earned.

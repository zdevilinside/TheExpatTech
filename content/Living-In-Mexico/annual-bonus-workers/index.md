## Annual Bonus (Aguinaldo) in Mexico

It’s that time of year again: workers in Mexico are entitled to their annual bonus, known as the **aguinaldo**. This is **not optional**—it is mandated by law.  

### What the Law Says

Under **Article 87 of the Federal Labor Law**, all employees must receive an annual bonus equivalent to at least **15 days of salary**, paid no later than **December 20th**. Even employees who have not completed a full year of service are entitled to a proportional payment based on the time they have worked.  

Recent legislative initiatives have proposed **increasing the minimum aguinaldo from 15 to 30 days of salary**, though as of late 2025 this reform is still under discussion. Employers should stay alert to updates, as this change could double the minimum obligation.  

### How to Calculate

1. **Weekly salary ÷ 6 = daily rate**  
2. **Daily rate × 15 = minimum aguinaldo**  

Example:  
- A gardener earning **$500 pesos per day, one day per week** → minimum bonus = **$1,000 pesos**.  
- A worker earning **$5,000 pesos per month** → minimum bonus = **$2,500 pesos**.  

Many employers choose to pay **two weeks’ salary** as a straightforward calculation, but the law requires at least 15 days.  

### Practical Guidance

- **Deadline:** Pay by **December 20th** each year.  
- **Scope:** Applies to all employees, including domestic staff such as gardeners, cleaners, and drivers.  
- **Documentation:** Keep written records of payments to avoid disputes.  
- **Penalties:** Late or missing payments can result in fines and legal complications.

So you want to become a resident of Mexico but don't know where to start?  Well, it isn't as easy as just moving to Mexico and you are a resident.  You have to follow specific steps to become one.  If you are thinking of just getting a FMM (AKA Tourist Visa) and live in Mexico on it, those days are rapidly coming to an end.  INM (Mexican Immigration) has now networked their systems so that they can see who is trying to game the system and live in Mexico without follow the legal process.  

Anyhow, one of the largest sticking points for Americans wanting to live in Mexico full-time is the income requirements.  Since 2016, Mexico has increased the financial requirements to qualify for residency visas significantly.  They used the country's Daily Minimum Wage to calculate the minimum monthly incomes for foreigners that wish to live legally in Mexico as a temporary or permanent resident.  

Mexico's daily minimum wage has gone up over 3x what it was since 2016.  That means that monthly incomes or savings/investments have increased along with those increases.  The minimum wage in Mexico was 73 pesos/day in 2016.  It is now 280 pesos a day.  

There is some formulas out there that you can use for exact #s, but I believe in making things easy for everyone and just give you the basics.

There are 4 main methods to qualify for residency in Mexico.  They are:
1. Demonstrating you have a minimum monthly net income; or
2. By holding a minimum balance in personal savings/investments; or
3. By owning a house in Mexico with a specified *minimum value*; or
4. By making a specified *capital investment* in a Mexican company.

Residency in Mexico using your monthly income - if you intend to use your monthly income to apply for residency at a Mexican consulate abroad, you need to show them that your monthly net income meets the following requirements:
---
| | |
|---|---|
|*Residency Type (2025)* | Monthly Income |
| *Temporary Residency* | A regular income of at least $4,185 per month, for every month, for the last 6 months.  Some consulates request 12 months.|
| *Permanent Residency* | A regular income of at least $6,975 per month, for every month, for the last 6 months.  Again, some consulates will request 12 months. |

Residency using your personal savings/investments - if you are going to use your **personal savings/investment balances** to apply for residency, you need to show savings and/or investment balances meeting these requirements:
---
| | |
|---|---|
| *Residency Type (2025)* | Savings/Investments|
| *Temporary Residency* | You must show at least a balance of $69,750 over the last 12 months.  The total cannot fall below the minimum amount at all in the last 12 months. |
| *Permanent Residency* | You must show at least a balance of $279,000 over the last 12 months.  Again, the total cannot fall below that minimum amount at all in the last 12 months. |

Residency in Mexico using the market value of your residential house:
---
- The property has to have a minimum market value of $11,160,000 pesos, and
- the property must be situated in Mexico;
- the property value must be free of any liens (debts, mortgages, or any other charges;
- the value to demonstrate is that noted on the title deed/sales contract, or from a recent official valuation;
- the name(s) on the title deed/sales contract **must** match that of the applicatant.  

Residency in Mexico using a capital investment
---
- You must make a capital investment of at least $5,580,000 pesos; and
- The capital must be invested in one of a prescribed sets of ways; and
- these applications are considerably more complex than applications that are made using one of the 3 other economic solvency routes.

Each year, Mexico increases these requirements.  If you are considering taking the plunge and are barely going to make the requirements, do so because after January 1, those requirements are going up and you may no longer qualify.

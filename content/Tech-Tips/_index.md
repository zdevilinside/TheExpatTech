I have been working in comptuers for a number of years and have come to the point where I don't really see nothing anymore I haven't seen previously in one form or another.  I am going to provide tips about things I have learned and how-to's to do various things in this area.  I hope the "grey beards" I know will help me with providing information to be shared with others here.

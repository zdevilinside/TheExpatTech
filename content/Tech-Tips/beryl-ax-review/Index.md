# 🌐 GL.iNet Beryl AX (GL-MT3000) Review

![image 1](image1.jpg)  

The **GL.iNet Beryl AX (GL-MT3000)** may not be the newest device on the market—with the Beryl 7 on the horizon—but it remains a staple in many digital nomads’ gear bags. I’ve used mine for years without issue, and it continues to be one of the most reliable budget VPN routers available.  

It’s compact, easy to set up, and perfect for situations where you need a secure, private network on the go. Whether you’re connecting in a hotel, café, or airport lounge, the Beryl AX gives you control and peace of mind.

## Why Digital Nomads Love It

One of the biggest advantages is how it handles **captive portals** (those login pages you encounter on public Wi‑Fi). Instead of entering credentials on every device, you log in once through the router, and all your connected devices piggyback on that session. It saves time and frustration, especially when juggling laptops, tablets, and phones.  

It also doubles as a **VPN hub**. With built‑in support for WireGuard and OpenVPN, you can encrypt traffic for all devices at once. This is invaluable when working remotely in countries with restrictive networks or when handling sensitive client data.

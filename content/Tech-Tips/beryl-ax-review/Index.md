# 🌐 GL.iNet Beryl AX (GL-MT3000) Review

![image 1](image1.jpg)  


I know this is an older piece of hardware that is about to have its follow on Beryl 7 released but this router is a staple of many a digital nomader's equipment. I have been using one for years without issue and I feel that it is a budget VPN router worth knowing about.  You can easily take it with you, use it in "capture portal" situations, and it gives you a separate network that all your devices can connect to.  Oh, and it can run a Wireguard client/server as needed along with several other VPN solutions.  

A "capture portal" is when you have to log in to a wifi network before you use is.  That means if you do that with the device and connect your other equipment to the travel router, you only have to enter that stupid password and/or username once to connect everything. I will be doing a Tech Tip post on this in the coming days.

For those out there that are wondering what in the heck that thing is in the back right of the picture, it is a Kensington Expert Mouse.  I have been using them since the late 1990s.  They cost about $80 or so on Amazon and last 10 to 15 years.  Yes, dinosaur me has a piece of equipment that he doesn't replace every 2 to 3 years like the rest of his gear.  

# So, what's so special about the Beryl AX?  

The **GL.iNet Beryl AX (GL-MT3000)** is a compact, powerful travel router offering Wi-Fi 6, strong VPN support, and has excellent portability. You can easily take it with you due to the size of its footprint: 4.1 inches x 3.5 inches x 1.5 inches — 105mm x 90 mm x 40 mm for those metric folks in the world. It is also lightweight — 0.5 lbs or 230 grams.  It is a robust piece of equipment too!  I only dropped it about half as many times as I was dropped on my head as a child and it works great still unlike this author.

The Beryl AX is a simple piece of equipment that just works.  I used it for my "Digital Nomad VPN Setup" article and it couldn't have been simpler.  GL.iNet has made things so that they are easy to setup for even the non-technically inclined.  You just need to follow the step-by-step guide to be able to setup your own private Wireguard server/clients.

## Why I use GL.iNet products for "Digital Nomad VPNs"  

A few years back, a friend of mine had a work-from-home job that required her to stay in one location. When a relative became sick, she needed to move temporarily to help care for them. Her boss refused to allow her to work from another city—even though it was only 120 miles away.  

She was stuck: she couldn’t afford to take time off, but she also couldn’t ignore her family obligations. That’s when I stepped in to help.  

After researching options, I discovered the **GL.iNet Brume 2**. By setting up one Brume 2 as a WireGuard server at her home and another as a client at her temporary location, we could make her laptop appear as if it was still in her original city.  

We tested it: before connecting, her IP showed the new city. After connecting through the Brume 2 client, her IP showed her home city. **Problem solved.** She worked remotely for 2.5 weeks, cared for her relative, and kept her job. Ironically, her inflexible supervisor was later terminated.  

That experience convinced me of the value of GL.iNet products. Since then, I’ve purchased and tested several of their devices for myself and for clients. While I’ve moved beyond the Brume 2 for most use cases, their lineup continues to impress me with performance, portability, and built-in VPN support.

## Why I am so favorable with GL.iNet equipment  

A few years back, a friend of mine had a work-from-home job that required her to work from a specific location.  Unfortunately for her, a relative had gotten sick and needed her to go live with them for a few weeks while they recovered.  She asked her boss if she could temporarily work from another state at a site 120 miles away.  Her boss would not allow her to do so.  

She was in a real pickle; the relative is someone that raised her and she felt obligated to help.  She couldn't afford to take time off to help because she would lose her job if she did that much time, it was a tough job market, and she turned to me to find a way to help her get through this.

After doing some research, I learned about how GL.iNet had a product (Brume 2) that was an answer.  You had to buy two of them, set one up at her home to act as a WireGuard server, and the other one would go with her and act as a WireGuard client.  We decided to give it a shot and see if it would work.

I set up the server at her house and we took the client to her friend's house the next town over.  We ran a WhatIsMyIPAddress.com check on what her laptop showed before we connected her system through the Brume 2.  It showed she was in her friend's city.  We then put the Brume 2 client in place, connected to WhatIsMyIPAddress.com and **BINGO** it showed her town as her location.  

My friend used her client and was able to work the 2.5 weeks while her relative recovered.  She then went back to her normal city of and continued to work as normal.  Her supervisor was later on terminated for their inflexibility with accomodations so this is just proof that what she did was the right thing to do.

Since that event, I have personnaly purchased quite a few of GL.iNet's products for my own and customers.  I have predominantly moved away from the Brume 2 though because the performance of their other equipment has led me to upgrade.  I am going to go through the different pieces of GL.iNet VPN equipment I have and provide you their specs, compare/contrast their performance, their equipment ports, use cases, and summarize them.

There you go!  That is all of the equipment I have and what segment they are best for.  I have other GL.iNet equipment on order that I will provide reviews and impression reports on shortly.

So you know, I am not just a GL.iNet fanboy.  I have other routing equipment from Synology, Netgear, TP-Link, Eero, and many others.  I just love their equipment in specific cases - when you need a built-in VPN solution that is easy to setup and get going.

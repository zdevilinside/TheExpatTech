## Welcome

This site is where I share aviation stories, practical tech tips, living in Mexico part-time, and lessons from digital nomading.  

Prior to my retirement, I started working in IT back in 1990.  

My first technical certification was for a **PowerBook** laptop in 1994.  

I earned my CompTIA A+ certification in 1999 and my first Dell certification later that year.  

Over the years, I earned many other certifications, and my final position before retirement was as a **Level 3 technician** at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), supporting Linux, Mac, and Windows systems on both the Yellow (unclassified) and Red (classified) networks.  

I was part of the Distinguished Performance Award–winning Project AngelFire team while working at LANL.  

Since then, I have moved to Mexico for retirement.  I really like living down here.  It seems like paradise for me.

I want to give special thanks to the friends who helped me get this site running after so long.  

These are the people who pushed me to finally get this going.  

We also got to see each other at a recent event in the Washington, D.C. area — GL.iNet’s 15th Anniversary Conference.  
I jokingly referred to us as *“The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse”* when we were together — purely in jest, as a playful nickname for our group.

Most of my VPN setups use GL.iNet equipment for a simple reason: GL.iNet’s equipment makes these setups quite easy to do.  

How much do I like their equipment?  

I have over 20 of their devices in use or on the shelf as backups.

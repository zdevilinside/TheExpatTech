## Welcome

This site is where I share aviation stories, practical tech tips, living in Mexico part-time and lessons from digital nomading.  Prior to my retirement, I started to work in the IT back in 1990.  My first technical certification was on a Powerbook laptop in 1994.  I got my CompTIA A+ certification in 1999 and my first Dell certification later that year.  I added many other certifications over the years and my final position before retirement was that of a level 3 technician at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) for Linux/Mac/Windows systems on both the Yellow (unclassified) and Red (classified) networks.  I was part of the Distinguished Performance Award winning Project AngelFire team while working at LANL.  


I wish to give a special thanks to the friends that have helped me get this site up after so long.  These are the people that helped me with getting this going.  We also got to see each other at a recent event in the Washington DC area - GL.iNet's 15th Anniversary Conference.  I jokingly called us "The Four Horsemen" when we were together.

Most of my VPN setups will use GL.iNet equipment for a simple reason: GL.iNet's equipment make these setups be quite easy to do.  How much do I like their equipment?  I have over 20 of their devices in use or on the shelf as a backup to something.

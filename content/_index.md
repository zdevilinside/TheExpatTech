## ✈️ Welcome

**Aviation stories, practical tech tips, and lessons from digital nomading — all in one place.**  
This site is where I share my experiences living part‑time in Mexico, working as a digital nomad, and reflecting on decades in IT.  
I began my career in 1990, earned certifications from CompTIA and Dell, and retired as a level 3 technician at Los Alamos National Laboratory. I was part of the Distinguished Performance Award winning Project AngelFire team while working at LANL.

## 🙌 Special Thanks

I wish to give a special thanks to the friends that helped me get this site up after so long. We also met at GL.iNet’s 15th Anniversary Conference in Washington DC — jokingly calling ourselves *“The Four Horsemen.”*

| ***Special thanks to:*** | These are the folks that pushed me to actually get a website up on the web and not just in my head. |

Most of my VPN setups use GL.iNet equipment — I have over 20 of their devices in use or on standby. Their simplicity and reliability make them my go‑to choice.

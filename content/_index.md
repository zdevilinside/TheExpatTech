## Welcome

This site is where I share aviation stories, practical tech tips, living in Mexico part-time and lessons from digital nomading.  

Dive into the posts below to explore what I’ve been working on.

I wish to give a special thanks to the friends that have helped me get this site up after so long.  These are the people that helped me with getting this going.  We also got to see each other at a recent event in the Washington DC area - GL.iNet's 15th Anniversary Conference.  I jokingly called us "The Four Horsemen" when we were together.

Most of my VPN setups will use GL.iNet equipment for a simple reason: GL.iNet's equipment make these setups be quite easy to do.  How much do I like their equipment?  I have over 20 of their devices in use or on the shelf as a backup to something.

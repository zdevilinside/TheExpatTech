## Well, what is this site?

Over the years, I have shared stories from my past. I often got told that I should write a book about my life. I would comment back:

> "Yeah, if I wrote a book about my life, it would be a #1 best seller — as a horror novel!"

Well, I never got around to writing that book but here I am to write about it in a website that you can enjoy.

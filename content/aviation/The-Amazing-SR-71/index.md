## The Blackbird

Many people don’t realize there were actually **two aircraft nicknamed the Blackbird**. The first was the **A‑12**, built by the CIA as a single‑seat reconnaissance aircraft. It was designated “A‑12” because it was the twelfth design in the *Archangel* series — “Archangel” being the program’s code name.  

Lockheed and Convair competed to build a replacement for the U‑2, which had become vulnerable to Soviet radar and missiles. The CIA initially favored Convair’s Kingfish design, but Lockheed’s A‑12 offered better specifications at lower cost. Track record mattered too: Convair’s B‑58 Hustler had been plagued by delays and overruns, while Lockheed had delivered the U‑2 on time and under budget.  

The A‑12 was built between 1962 and 1964 and flew operationally from 1963 until 1968. It was the direct precursor to the SR‑71 Blackbird, the M‑21 (which launched the D‑21 drone), and the YF‑12 interceptor prototype. Originally, the A‑12 was intended for missions over Cuba and the Soviet Union, but those plans were abandoned after Francis Gary Powers was shot down in a U‑2 in 1960.

The **SR‑71 Blackbird** was developed as a follow‑on to the A‑12. Unlike its predecessor, it was a two‑seat aircraft flown by the U.S. Air Force. Revealed publicly in 1964 and entering service in 1966, the SR‑71 could cruise at **Mach 3.2 at 85,000 feet**. Its speed and altitude allowed it to evade or outrun virtually any threat. When surface‑to‑air missiles (SAMs) were launched, the standard evasive maneuver was simply to accelerate — outrunning the missile. Over 4,000 SAMs were fired at Blackbirds during their service, and not one ever successfully shot one down.  

The only time an aircraft was damaged during a mission occurred on **October 30, 1967**, when A‑12 pilot Dennis Sullivan struck missile debris during a sortie.

### Black Shield Missions

This flight was part of the **Black Shield** missions over North Vietnam. On Sullivan’s first pass, radar tracking was detected but no missiles were launched. On his second pass, at least six SAMs were fired. Mission photography confirmed the launches by capturing vapor trails, and Sullivan himself witnessed three detonations near and behind the aircraft while flying at Mach 3.1 at 84,000 feet. The A‑12 survived, though post‑mission inspection revealed damage from missile fragments.

### Retirement and Politics

The SR‑71 flew from 1964 until 1989, when it was retired from Air Force service. The decision was largely political. Several aircraft were briefly reactivated in the 1990s before their final retirement in 1998.  

One story often told is that General Larry Welch, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, had once been denied an assignment to fly the SR‑71 as a junior officer. Reportedly, he disliked the program ever since and worked to terminate it once he had the authority. Whether or not this account is fully accurate, it reflects the political tensions surrounding the aircraft’s high operating costs and unique mission profile.  

Many believe the SR‑71 was retired far too soon. I agree. I was among the crowd that witnessed the SR‑71 land at Dulles Airport on its final operational flight, en route to the Smithsonian.

## Records Held by the Blackbird Family

The Blackbird family set numerous records that still stand today. These achievements highlight why the aircraft remains legendary.

| Date | Record | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| *May 1, 1965* | **Absolute altitude** | 80,257.86 ft |
|              | **Absolute speed over straight course** | 2,070.101 mph |
|              | **Absolute speed over 500 km closed course** | 1,688.889 mph |
|              | **Absolute speed over 1,000 km closed course** | 1,643.041 mph |
| *September 1, 1974* | **New York to London** | 1 hr 54 min 56.4 sec |
| *September 13, 1974* | **London to Los Angeles** | 3 hr 47 min 39 sec |

When the SR‑71 was retired, its final flight from Edwards Air Force Base to Dulles Airport set additional records:

| Date | Record | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| *March 6, 1990* | **West Coast to East Coast** | 1 hr 7 min 53.69 sec |
|                 | **Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.** | 1 hr 4 min 19.89 sec |
|                 | **St. Louis to Cincinnati** | 8 min 31.97 sec |
|                 | **Kansas City to Washington, D.C.** | 25 min 58.53 sec |

## Why the Blackbird Was Special

The SR‑71 wasn’t just fast — it was a marvel of engineering. Its titanium skin expanded several inches during flight due to heat, which is why the aircraft leaked fuel on the ground; the seals only tightened at high speed. Its J58 engines transitioned from turbojet to ramjet‑like operation above Mach 2.5, enabling sustained Mach 3+ cruise.  

Combined with its stealthy design, advanced sensors, and unmatched speed, the SR‑71 remains one of the most extraordinary aircraft ever built. Its records speak for themselves — and decades later, no operational aircraft has surpassed them.

## ✨ Did You Know? SR‑71 Quirks and Secrets

- 🛢️ **Fuel Leaks Were Normal**  
  On the ground, the SR‑71 constantly leaked fuel. Its tanks only sealed properly once the airframe expanded from the heat of Mach 3 flight.  

- 👩‍🚀 **Pilots Wore Space Suits**  
  At 85,000 feet, the cockpit environment was so extreme that crews wore full pressure suits similar to those used by astronauts.  

- 🔥 **Skin Temperatures Exceeded 600°F**  
  At Mach 3+, the aircraft’s titanium skin glowed red‑orange from friction with the atmosphere.  

- 🛠️ **Special Tools Were Required**  
  Standard tools couldn’t be used on the SR‑71 because titanium galled easily. Mechanics used custom‑built tools and even silver plating to prevent damage.  

- ⏱️ **Mission Planning Was Critical**  
  Despite its speed, the SR‑71 required careful refueling and route planning. A single mission could involve multiple aerial refuelings and coordination across continents.  

- 📡 **Sensors Were Cutting‑Edge**  
  The SR‑71 carried advanced cameras and electronic sensors that could map entire countries in a single flight, providing intelligence unmatched by satellites of the era.

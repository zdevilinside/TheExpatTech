I have been a fan of aviation for quite some time. Growing up, I read everything I could about airplanes. When I was in AFJROTC as a freshman in high school, I memorized performance characteristics and dreamed of becoming a pilot. I learned as much as I could about flying and went up every chance I had.  

Later, when I attended a boarding military school, I joined its aviation program where students could learn to fly. I took lessons there and also in the mountains near home during school breaks. Those experiences taught me so much about aviation, and now I want to share that knowledge with you.  

I’ll begin with lists of my favorite planes, highlight some of their performance specifications that I find especially interesting, and finish with broader aviation stories. I hope you enjoy what I share here.

## ✨ Did You Know? Aviation Quirks

- 🛩️ **SR‑71 Blackbird Fuel Leaks**  
  On the ground, the SR‑71 constantly leaked fuel. Its titanium skin only sealed tight once heated at Mach 3.  

- 👩‍✈️ **First Female Flight Attendant**  
  Ellen Church became the world’s first flight attendant in 1930, flying with United Airlines.  

- 🌍 **Wright Brothers Perspective**  
  The longest flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903 was 120 feet — shorter than a Boeing 747’s wingspan.  

- 🔥 **Jet Engine Heat**  
  At full power, SR‑71 engines generated exhaust temperatures hotter than molten lava.  

- 🛰️ **Reconnaissance Reach**  
  A single SR‑71 mission could photograph an area the size of California in under an hour.

Aviation is more than just machines — it’s a story of innovation, daring, and discovery. From the Wright brothers’ fragile flyer to Cold War Blackbirds streaking across the sky, each aircraft tells us something about the era it was built in and the people who flew it.

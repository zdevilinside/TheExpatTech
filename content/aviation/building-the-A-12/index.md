At one time, this was the classification level of this information.  Today, it has been declassified.  I hope people think about this when they read this.....

Kelly Johnson's drawings of the Archangel designs alongside Convair's competing Fish and Kingfish concepts. 



![The A-1](a-1-archangel.jpg)  
The A‑1 was Lockheed’s first attempt at a U‑2 successor. It was essentially a paper study with a long fuselage and conventional wings, but it lacked the performance needed to outrun Soviet defenses. It showed Johnson’s team was thinking about speed and altitude but hadn’t yet solved the radar visibility problem.  

![The A-2](a-2-archangel.jpg)  
The A‑2 introduced more radical shaping, including thinner wings and a fuselage designed to reduce drag at high Mach numbers. It was an early step toward incorporating *chines* — the sharp edges along the fuselage that later became a defining feature of the A‑12 and SR‑71. These chines helped deflect radar waves and added lift at supersonic speeds.  

![Convair Fish](convairfish.jpg)  
Convair’s “Fish” design was bold, aiming for Mach 3 performance with ramjet propulsion. However, it was too far ahead of available materials and engine technology. The CIA judged it impractical, as it couldn’t meet both speed and survivability requirements. Fish was quickly abandoned in favor of Convair’s Kingfish.  

![A-7 through A-9](a-7-9.jpg)  
The A‑7 through A‑9 designs show Lockheed experimenting with engine placement and wing sweep. These iterations tested how to balance *Pratt & Whitney J58 turbojet integration* with fuel efficiency and radar cross‑section reduction. Each design moved closer to the blended fuselage‑wing shape that defined the A‑12.  

![A-10 design](a-10.jpg)  
The A‑10 was one of the most advanced Archangel concepts. It incorporated titanium structures to withstand the heat of Mach 3 flight and refined chines for stealth. Johnson’s team was already working with radar‑absorbing composites, cutting radar returns by up to 90% compared to earlier designs.  

![Convair Kingfish](Kingfish.jpg)  
Convair’s Kingfish was the strongest competitor. It promised high speed and altitude, but its design sacrificed stealth for performance. Lockheed’s A‑12, with its chines, canted twin tails, and radar‑absorbing materials, struck a better balance. In 1959, the CIA awarded Lockheed the contract under *Project GUSTO*, leading to *Project Oxcart* and the A‑12.  

According to *Ben Rich's Skunk Works*, Kelly Johnson was close to quitting the competition when the CIA intervened and gave Lockheed the contract. That decision produced the A‑12 and, ultimately, the SR‑71 — aircraft capable of sustained Mach 3+ cruise at altitudes above 80,000 feet.  

![A-12](a-12.jpg)  
The A‑12 was the winning design. Built largely of titanium, it used *Pratt & Whitney J58 engines* with bleed‑bypass systems to handle extreme speeds. Its chines, radar‑absorbing composites, and canted tails made it the first operational stealth aircraft. The A‑12 flew in 1962 and directly led to the SR‑71 Blackbird, one of the most iconic reconnaissance aircraft ever built.

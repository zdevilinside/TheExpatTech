Throughout the 20th century, the United States achieved countless innovations in aviation. From Orville and Wilbur Wright’s first flight at Kitty Hawk, NC, to today’s advanced aircraft, there have been milestones that would have seemed impossible to the generation before.  

I break down my favorite airplanes into three eras: World War II and before, the Cold War, and Modern Day. I know that’s a small number of categories compared to the full scope of aviation advances, but I’m organizing them this way as I start building my website. My goal is to generate as many stories as possible so there’s plenty of content for everyone. Believe me when I say this page will continue to grow with ongoing updates and additions.  

The **P‑38 Lightning** is my favorite World War II aircraft. Its twin engines and twin tails made it stand out from all others. The Germans nicknamed it *“der Gabelschwanz-Teufel”* — the Fork‑Tailed Devil. It was the aircraft used to shoot down Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto during Operation Vengeance. The P‑38 was also flown by America’s leading ace, Richard Bong, who scored 40 kills, and Thomas McGuire Jr., who had 38.

The **SR‑71 Blackbird** is my favorite aircraft of the Cold War. I’ve been a fan since I was 13 years old, when I first learned about its incredible capabilities. I was amazed that it could fly at 80,000 feet and reach Mach 3. That discovery led me to dig deeper, and I uncovered some fascinating facts about this legendary plane.

## 1–10: Cold War & Wright Brothers Highlights

1. 🚀 **SR‑71 Blackbird Origins**  
   The SR‑71 was born from the CIA’s OXCART program. Its predecessor, the A‑12, was designed for covert reconnaissance missions. The SR‑71 expanded on that design, adding a second crew member and more advanced sensors, making it the ultimate Cold War spy plane.  

2. 🔧 **A‑12 Design Lineage**  
   The “A‑12” designation wasn’t random — it was literally the twelfth design iteration. Earlier prototypes (A‑1 through A‑11) explored different wing shapes, engine placements, and stealth features before Johnson’s team settled on the A‑12.  

3. 👨‍🔬 **Kelly Johnson’s Genius**  
   Clarence “Kelly” Johnson, founder of Lockheed’s Skunk Works, was the driving force behind both the U‑2 and the A‑12/SR‑71. His “Kelly’s 14 Rules” for rapid aircraft development became legendary in aerospace engineering.  

4. 🎯 **Missile‑Proof Marvel**  
   During its service, more than 4,000 missiles were fired at the Blackbird family. None ever hit. Its speed, altitude, and evasive maneuvers made it untouchable — pilots joked that the plane simply “outran the threat.”  

5. 💥 **North Korea Incident**  
   In 1968, A‑12 Article 129 (serial 60‑6932) was damaged when debris from a Soviet‑built SA‑2 missile struck it over North Korea. Despite the damage, the aircraft returned safely, proving the resilience of its titanium structure.  

6. 🪙 **Cold War Irony**  
   The Blackbird family relied on titanium to survive Mach 3 heat. Ironically, most of that titanium was secretly purchased from the Soviet Union — the very adversary the aircraft was designed to spy on.  

7. 🤓 **Ben Rich on Stealth Theory**  
   Lockheed engineer Ben Rich explained that the F‑117 stealth fighter was based on Soviet physicist Pyotr Ufimtsev’s radar theory. He joked that the paper was so dense it required “a nerd’s nerd” to understand — but it gave the U.S. a stealth advantage.  

8. 👀 **Witnesses to History**  
   On December 17, 1903, fewer than 10 people saw the Wright brothers’ first flight. It was a quiet beginning to what would become a global revolution in transportation.  

9. 📏 **Perspective on Wright Flight**  
   The longest flight that day was about 120 feet. To put that in perspective, a Boeing 747’s wingspan is 210 feet — meaning the Wrights’ entire flight path was shorter than the width of a modern jumbo jet.  

10. ✈️ **First Flight Compared to Today**  
    The Wrights’ 12‑second flight could fit inside the economy section of a 747. It’s a reminder of how far aviation has come in just over a century.

## 11–25: U.S. Aviation Industry & Milestones

11. 🛫 **U.S. Airlines Carry Hundreds of Millions of Passengers**  
    In 2019, U.S. airlines transported **853 million passengers**. That’s more than twice the population of the country, showing how aviation became essential to everyday life.  

12. 👩‍✈️ **First Female Flight Attendant Was American**  
    Ellen Church, a registered nurse, became the world’s first flight attendant in 1930 with United Airlines. She paved the way for women in aviation careers.  

13. 🌩️ **Planes Can Be Struck by Lightning — And It’s Safe**  
    Modern aircraft are designed to channel lightning strikes safely through the fuselage. On average, each plane is struck once per year, but passengers rarely notice thanks to engineering safeguards.  

14. 🍽️ **Airplane Food Tastes Different in the Sky**  
    At altitude, passengers lose about one‑third of their taste sensitivity. Airlines adjust recipes with stronger flavors to compensate, which is why tomato juice and spicy foods are popular in flight.  

15. 🛩️ **Air Traffic Control Scale**  
    The FAA manages service for around **2.9 million passengers daily**. That’s equivalent to coordinating the population of a major city moving through the skies every single day.  

16. 🌍 **Amelia Earhart’s U.S. Milestones**  
    Earhart wasn’t just the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932. She also completed the first solo flights from Hawaii to the mainland and from Mexico to New York in 1935, proving long‑distance aviation was possible.  

17. 🛬 **Birth of Air Traffic Control**  
    Formal air traffic control began in the U.S. in 1926. Before that, pilots relied on visual signals and basic radio communication — a system that became unsustainable as skies grew crowded.  

18. 🏢 **Atlanta Airport Is the World’s Busiest**  
    Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport has consistently ranked as the busiest passenger airport globally, handling more than 100 million travelers annually.  

19. 📦 **Memphis Is a Cargo Giant**  
    Memphis International Airport became one of the world’s busiest cargo hubs thanks to FedEx, which is headquartered there. Its overnight shipping model revolutionized logistics.  

20. 🏛️ **Airline Deregulation Act of 1978**  
    Deregulation transformed U.S. aviation by lowering fares, increasing competition, and opening the skies to new carriers. It marked the beginning of the modern airline industry.  

21. 🛠️ **First U.S. Pilot License**  
    The FAA issued its first pilot license in 1927 to William P. MacCracken Jr., who later became the first Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Aeronautics.  

22. 📨 **Air Mail Act of 1925**  
    This act laid the foundation for commercial aviation by allowing private companies to carry U.S. mail. Many early airlines grew out of mail routes.  

23. 🏆 **Charles Lindbergh’s Transatlantic Flight**  
    Lindbergh’s 1927 solo flight from New York to Paris wasn’t just a stunt — it proved long‑distance air travel was possible and boosted public confidence in aviation.  

24. 🛫 **American Airlines Is the Largest Carrier**  
    After merging with US Airways in 2013, American Airlines became the world’s largest airline by passengers carried, cementing its dominance in U.S. aviation.  

25. 🛡️ **U.S. Aviation Safety Record**  
    The U.S. maintains one of the safest aviation systems in the world, overseen by the FAA and NTSB. Continuous improvements in training, technology, and regulation have made flying safer than ever.

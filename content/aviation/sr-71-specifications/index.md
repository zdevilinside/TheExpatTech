# General Characteristics

## Dimensions and Capacities

|Specification        |Value                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Crew**             | 2                              |
| **Length**           | 107 ft 5 in (32.74 m)          |
| **Wingspan**         | 55 ft 7 in (16.94 m)           |
| **Height**           | 18 ft 6 in (5.64 m)            |
| **Wheel track**      | 16 ft 8 in (5.00 m)            |
| **Wheelbase**        | 37 ft 10 in (12.00 m)          |
| **Aspect ratio**     | 1.7                            |
| **Wing area**        | 1,800 sq ft (170 sq m)         |
| **Empty weight**     | 67,500 lbs (30,617 kg)         |
| **Gross weight**     | 152,000 lbs (68,946 kg)        |
| **Max takeoff weight** | 172,000 lbs (78,018 kg)      |
| **Fuel capacity**    | 12,219 US gal (46,255 L)       |
| **Powerplant**       | 2 × Pratt & Whitney J58        |

### Context
- The SR‑71’s **crew of two** (pilot and reconnaissance systems officer) was essential: one flew the aircraft, the other managed sensors and navigation at extreme speeds.  
- Its **length of 107 feet** made it longer than a Boeing 737, yet its **wingspan of only 55 feet** gave it a sleek, dart‑like profile optimized for supersonic flight.  
- The **aspect ratio of 1.7** shows how stubby the wings were — designed for speed, not maneuverability.  
- The **fuel capacity of over 12,000 gallons** was necessary because the J58 engines consumed fuel at astonishing rates. Even then, the SR‑71 often required multiple aerial refuelings during missions.  
- The **Pratt & Whitney J58 engines** were unique: they operated as turbojets at lower speeds but transitioned to a hybrid turbojet/ramjet mode above Mach 2.5, allowing sustained Mach 3+ flight.

## Performance

| Specification        | Value                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Maximum speed**    | 1,910 kn (2,200 mph)           |
| **Maximum Mach**     | Mach 3.3+                      |
| **Ferry range**      | 2,824 nmi (3,250 mi)           |
| **Service ceiling**  | 85,000 ft                      |
| **Rate of climb**    | 11,820 ft/min                  |
| **Wing loading**     | 84 lbs/sq ft                   |

### Context
- The SR‑71’s **maximum speed of 2,200 mph** meant it could outrun threats rather than dodge them. Pilots often joked that “speed was life.”  
- Its **Mach 3.3+ capability** wasn’t just a headline number — the aircraft could cruise at those speeds for hours, something no other operational jet has matched.  
- The **service ceiling of 85,000 feet** placed it well above most surface‑to‑air missile envelopes and fighter interceptors. Pilots reported seeing the curvature of the Earth and the deep black of space.  
- A **rate of climb of nearly 12,000 ft/min** allowed the SR‑71 to reach operational altitude quickly, minimizing exposure during takeoff and ascent.  
- The **wing loading of 84 lbs/sq ft** reflected its design trade‑off: small wings for speed meant high wing loading, making the aircraft less agile but perfectly suited for straight‑line reconnaissance runs.

## Notes

- All dimensions are approximate.  
- Weights reflect a typical operational configuration.  
- Speeds represent maximum achievable under optimal conditions.  

### Context
- The SR‑71’s numbers don’t tell the whole story. Its titanium skin expanded several inches during flight due to heat, which is why the aircraft leaked fuel on the ground — the seals only tightened at high speeds.  
- The aircraft’s performance envelope was so extreme that even routine missions required careful planning of refueling points, weather conditions, and threat assessments.  
- Despite its complexity, the SR‑71 flew for over 30 years without ever being shot down, cementing its reputation as one of the greatest engineering achievements in aviation history.

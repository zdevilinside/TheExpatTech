This week marks the launch of my site, so I’m adding content quickly to get things up and running. I’ve been proactive in reaching out to other creators to ask if it’s okay for me to share this type of content before posting. Technically, I don’t need permission as long as I provide proper credit and never present their work as my own — I have no intention of infringing on anyone’s copyright. Still, I believe it’s the right thing to do morally, and I want to respect the creators whose work I reference.

## Week 48 Highlights

This week brought a mix of stories that resonated with me — from digital nomad rankings to tech debates, and even a little Broncos pride.

### 🌍 Digital Nomad Rankings
*[Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/travel/2025/10/20/worlds-top-10-countries-for-digital-nomads-revealed-and-seven-are-in-europe)* published its list of the world’s top 10 countries for digital nomads. Having traveled to several of these, I can’t fault their choices. Still, I wish Mexico had been included — cities like **Mexico City, Mérida, Guadalajara, and Puerto Vallarta** are vibrant hubs for nomads.

> **Reflection:** Lists like these often skew toward Europe, but Latin America has quietly become a powerhouse for remote work. Mexico’s omission feels like a missed opportunity to highlight its growing nomad infrastructure.

### 💻 NASCompares Visits Beelink
NASCompares toured Beelink, a company whose mini PCs I’ve purchased for clients. Their deep dive into hardware and design was impressive — a reminder of how far compact computing has come since the early nettop days.

### 🎥 Meeting Dave’s Garage
At the **GL.iNet conference in Fairfax, VA**, I had the chance to meet Dave from Dave’s Garage. He’s as genuine in person as he is on camera, and his commentary on tech trends continues to be sharp and insightful.

### 🏡 House Hunters: Cuernavaca Edition
A friend shared this *[Cuernavaca House Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAbQCpViKuc)*.  
The house sits across from Costco, half a mile from Walmart, and offers **3 bedrooms, 3.5 baths, 1600 sq ft, pool, tennis courts, and weekly maid/laundry service** — all for **18,000 pesos/month (~$900 USD)**.

> **Sidebar:** For digital nomads, Mexico’s housing market often delivers surprising value. Properties like this highlight why Cuernavaca and similar cities are gaining traction among expats.

### 🤖 NAS and AI — Do We Want It?
NASCompares asked whether users even want AI in their NAS devices. Personally, I don’t. The Reddit reactions he shared were hilarious — skepticism seems widespread.

### 🌐 Why the Internet Went Down
Dave explains a major outage, drawing on his background as a retired Microsoft engineer. It’s a reminder of how fragile global infrastructure can be, and how much expertise goes into diagnosing failures.

### 🖥️ Making Windows 11 User-Friendly
*[MakeUseOf: Windows 11 Features](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-needs-these-features/)* published a guide to improving Windows 11 usability. I implemented several tips:  
- Moving the Start menu  
- Enabling System Protection  
- Showing file extensions  

That last tweak alone has made building this website far easier.

### 📡 GL.iNet Devices — Specs Debate
NASCompares discussed upcoming GL.iNet devices. I caught a small mistake in their specs and reached out — they corrected it quickly. It’s always fun to be part of the feedback loop, especially when you already have the hardware in hand.

### 🛂 Digital Nomad Visas
*[Forbes: Nomad Visas](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2025/11/09/digital-nomad-visas-5-countries-with-the-best-work-life-balance-per-2025-reports/)* highlighted five countries offering the best work-life balance through nomad visas. Having visited six of the cities mentioned, I can vouch for the accuracy of their list. These visas are reshaping how people plan long-term remote work.

### 🏈 Broncos Rising
As a lifelong **Denver Broncos fan**, I follow:  
- *[BroncosWire](https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/)*  
- *[DenverBroncos.com](https://www.denverbroncos.com/)*  
- *[Predominantly Orange](https://predominantlyorange.com/)*  

Recent highlights:  
- *[Predominantly Orange Story](https://predominantlyorange.com/broncos-get-major-boost-to-division-chances-after-chiefs-thanksgiving-loss-01kb63gm3tct)* gave me hope for the division race.  
- *[Bleacher Report Rankings](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25304632-br-experts-week-13-nfl-power-rankings?utm_source=cnn.com&utm_medium=referral)* finally show the media taking the Broncos seriously.

> **Reflection:** After years of ups and downs, it’s refreshing to see the Broncos regain momentum. Sports fandom, like tech and nomading, is about resilience and community.

## ✨ Closing Thoughts
Week 48 was a reminder of how interconnected my interests are — aviation, tech, nomading, and even football. Each story reflects a piece of the broader digital nomad lifestyle: staying curious, staying connected, and finding joy in both the technical and the personal.

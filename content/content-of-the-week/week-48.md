This week marks the launch of my site, so I’m adding content quickly to get things up and running. I’ve been proactive in reaching out to other creators to ask if it’s okay for me to share this type of content before posting. Technically, I don’t need permission as long as I provide proper credit and never present their work as my own — I have no intention of infringing on anyone’s copyright. Still, I believe it’s the right thing to do morally, and I want to respect the creators whose work I reference.

## Week 48 Highlights

This week brought a mix of stories that resonated with me — from digital nomad rankings to tech debates, and even a little Broncos pride.

### 🌍 Digital Nomad Rankings
**[Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/travel/2025/10/20/worlds-top-10-countries-for-digital-nomads-revealed-and-seven-are-in-europe)** published its list of the world’s top 10 countries for digital nomads. Having traveled to several of these, I can’t fault their choices. Still, I wish Mexico had been included — cities like **Mexico City, Mérida, Guadalajara, and Puerto Vallarta** are vibrant hubs for nomads.

### 💻 NASCompares Visits Beelink
**[NASCompares](https://nascompares.com/)** toured **[Beelink](https://www.bee-link.com/)**, a company whose mini PCs I’ve purchased for clients. Their deep dive into hardware and design was impressive — a reminder of how far compact computing has come since the early nettop days.

### 🚗 Normal Guy Supercar
**Normal Guy Supercar AKA Dan** is truly a nice guy. I got to meet him a few years back during his [Influencers Invasion](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTQrm5ziMSDg5uvXFvQO6LdUEv05stLkf).  
In this story, Dan is discussing a great idea about how they are going to start listing consignment cars.

### 🎥 Meeting Dave’s Garage
At the **GL.iNet conference in Fairfax, VA**, I had the chance to meet **[Dave from Dave’s Garage](https://www.youtube.com/@DavesGarage)**. He’s as genuine in person as he is on camera, and his commentary on tech trends continues to be sharp and insightful.

### 🏡 House Hunters: Cuernavaca Edition
A friend shared this **[Cuernavaca House Tour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAbQCpViKuc)** with me.  
The house sits across from Costco, half a mile from Walmart, and offers **3 bedrooms, 3.5 baths, 1600 sq ft, pool, tennis courts, and weekly maid/laundry service** — all for **18,000 pesos/month (~$1000 USD)**.  Talk about great, inexpensive living!!!

### 🤖 NAS and AI — Do We Want It?
**[NASCompares](https://nascompares.com/)** asked whether users even want AI in their NAS devices. Personally, I don’t. The Reddit reactions he shared were hilarious — skepticism seems widespread.

### 🌐 Why the Internet Went Down
**[Dave](https://www.youtube.com/@DavesGarage)** explains a major outage, drawing on his background as a retired Microsoft engineer. It’s a reminder of how fragile global infrastructure can be, and how much expertise goes into diagnosing failures.

### 🖥️ Making Windows 11 User-Friendly
**[MakeUseOf](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-needs-these-features/)** published a guide to improving Windows 11 usability. I implemented several tips:  
- Moving the Start menu  
- Enabling System Protection  
- Showing file extensions  

That last tweak alone has made building this website far easier.

### 📡 GL.iNet Devices — Specs Debate
**[NASCompares](https://nascompares.com/)** discussed upcoming **[GL.iNet](https://www.gl-inet.com/)** devices. I caught a small mistake in their specs and reached out — they corrected it quickly. It’s always fun to be part of the feedback loop, especially when you already have the hardware in hand.

### 🛂 Digital Nomad Visas
**[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexledsom/2025/11/09/digital-nomad-visas-5-countries-with-the-best-work-life-balance-per-2025-reports/)** highlighted five countries offering the best work-life balance through digital nomad visas. Having visited six of the cities mentioned, I can vouch for the accuracy of their list. These visas are reshaping how people work and live in the world today.  It is an amazing opportunity for those that can do this!

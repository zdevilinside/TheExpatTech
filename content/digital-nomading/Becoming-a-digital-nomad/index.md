You are feeling wunderlust.  Your job is online so you feel that you can start working from anywhere.  You decide to give it a go.  You look online at the rules needed to travel the world while working online.  That is how you get your start.  This site will explain *my* path down this rabbit hole.

In my case, it came about as a necessity.  I was on my way to graduate school in Germany when that was cut short due to illness.  I looked around and did research online for the best places to go and live for 6 months before I gave another shot at going to Germany.

I chatted with others online and came to the decision to go to Cuernavaca, Mexico for those 6 months.  We decided to give it a go and try to make extra money online.  We succeeded but it wasn't an easy process to say the least.  After all we have gone through, we are now permanent residents of Mexico and have no intention of ever leaving it to go back to the United States permanently.  We will always remain US citizens and travel back often though.

You’re feeling wanderlust. Your job is online, so you realize you can start working from anywhere. You decide to give it a try. You research the rules and requirements for traveling the world while working remotely — and that’s how the journey begins. This site explains *my* path down that rabbit hole.  

In my case, it came about as a necessity. I was on my way to graduate school in Germany when illness cut those plans short. Looking for alternatives, I researched the best places to live for six months before trying again.  

Through online conversations and careful planning, I decided to spend those six months in **Cuernavaca, Mexico**. We gave it a go, working to earn extra money online. It wasn’t easy, but we succeeded. After everything we’ve experienced, we are now permanent residents of Mexico and have no intention of leaving permanently for the United States. We remain U.S. citizens and travel back often, but Mexico is home.

## Reflection

Becoming a digital nomad isn’t just about travel — it’s about resilience, adaptation, and redefining what “home” means. For me, the journey started with necessity but became a lifestyle. Mexico gave me stability, community, and the freedom to keep exploring while staying connected to my roots.

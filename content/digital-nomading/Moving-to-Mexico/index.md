description: "How I became a Digital Nomad"
---

In 2015, I was on my way to graduate school in Germany. I made it as far as Amsterdam when I was unexpectedly hospitalized for 15 days. Unfortunately, the program began on the seventh day of my stay, and the German university would not allow a late start. My plans collapsed, and I had to return to the United States.  

By then, we had already sold our house, so I needed to find a new place to live quickly. My requirements were clear: the location had to be inexpensive, have reliable high‑speed internet, be near a major international airport, and — most importantly — be somewhere warm, where “snow” was a foreign word and the only ice you encountered was in your drink.  

That moment of disruption became the turning point. What started as a setback transformed into the beginning of my digital nomad journey. Instead of settling back into a traditional routine, I began looking for places where I could live affordably, stay connected online, and keep the freedom to travel.

## ✨ Did You Know? Digital Nomad Beginnings

- 🌍 **Amsterdam as a Gateway**  
  Many nomads begin their journeys in Europe because of its dense network of international airports and easy cross‑border travel.  

- 💻 **Internet as a Lifeline**  
  For digital nomads, reliable internet is often more important than housing or amenities. It determines whether remote work is possible.  

- 🧳 **Selling Everything First**  
  Many nomads start after selling their homes or possessions, which forces them to embrace minimalism and mobility.  

- ❄️ **Chasing the Sun**  
  A large percentage of nomads deliberately choose warm climates — not just for comfort, but because winter costs (heating, clothing, etc.) are much higher.  

- 🛫 **Airport Proximity Matters**  
  Living near a major international airport makes spontaneous travel easier and often cheaper, a key factor for nomads.

## Reflection

What felt like failure in 2015 — missing graduate school in Germany — became the foundation of a new lifestyle. By reframing the setback, I discovered the freedom of working online and living abroad. Becoming a digital nomad wasn’t a planned choice; it was born out of necessity, resilience, and the desire to turn disruption into opportunity.

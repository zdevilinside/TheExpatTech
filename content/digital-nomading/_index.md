I may not know much about how to land an online job, but I can share my experiences. What I do know is how to handle the technical side of things that can make your nomad journey easier.  

I won’t help you find employment or bypass rules and regulations in the places you want to visit. What I **will** do is share practical knowledge that makes remote work and travel smoother. For example, setting up a Digital Nomad VPN using WireGuard is one of those tasks—it’s actually quite straightforward once you know how.  

While I don’t have the deep technical background to troubleshoot every issue, I’ll continue to share what I learn along the way. My goal is to provide insights and tips that make the digital nomad lifestyle more accessible and less intimidating.

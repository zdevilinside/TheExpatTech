I may not know much about how to get an online job, I can give you information on my experiences.  I know how to do things that are technical in nature to help you with your nomad experience.  I won't help you get a job, get around rules/regulations of places you want to visit, but I **WILL** share with you what I know how to do to make this an easier experience.  Things such as how to setup a Digital Nomad VPN using Wireguard is one such thing.  It is actually quite easy to do.  Unfortunately, I do not have the technical background to answer questions on how to fix it but will share knowledge as I learn it.

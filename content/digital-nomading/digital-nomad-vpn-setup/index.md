Okay, you have made the decision. You want to take a chance with your job and work from somewhere that you are not authorized. You now need to set things up so that you can make it the least likely to get caught. You agree not to hold me responsible for any outcome you have if you are caught doing what I am about to show you how to do.  

First things first, you have to talk about the prerequisite requirements before you attempt to set this up. I will be using GL.iNet devices for this setup because it is the most "friendly" way to do this. If you’re not very technical, this is the easiest way to follow along. It **does** take some skill to set up, but this guide will walk you through it step by step.  

1. Buy 2 GL.iNet routers — one full router and one travel router.  
2. We’ll be using **WireGuard** as the VPN technology.  
3. If you’re not using GL.iNet routers on both sides, this post isn’t for you.  
4. I’ll use a GL.iNet Beryl AX to demonstrate both the VPN server and client setup.  
5. From now on:  
   - **Server** = “HOME” system (where you want to appear to be).  
   - **Client** = the device you travel with (your actual location).  
6. LAN = Local, WAN = World.  
7. You’ll need to configure **port forwarding** on your ISP’s modem/router. Search YouTube or [portforward.com](https://portforward.com/router.htm) for instructions. Use **UDP port 51820**.

## Notes

- Leave the server plugged in and connected to your ISP while you’re away.  
- Make sure whoever hosts your server has a fast internet package — ideally fiber, or cable as second best.  
- Latency and speed are critical for a smooth VPN experience.

## 🌍 Reflection: Why This Matters for Digital Nomads

Setting up a VPN isn’t just about technology — it’s about freedom. For digital nomads, a reliable VPN means you can work securely from anywhere, protect your privacy, and maintain access to the tools you need no matter where you are. It’s the backbone of remote independence.  

Whether you’re connecting from a café in Mexico, a coworking hub in Lisbon, or a mountain lodge in the Alps, this setup ensures your digital footprint stays safe while your lifestyle stays flexible. In the end, the VPN is more than a technical trick — it’s part of the toolkit that makes nomad life possible.

### Prerequisites

1. Buy 2 GL.iNet routers — one full router and one travel router.  
   For recommended **GL.iNet devices**, [click here](/digital-nomading/recommended-vpn-hardware).  
2. We’ll be using **WireGuard** as the VPN technology.  
3. If you’re not using GL.iNet routers on both sides, this post isn’t for you.  
4. I’ll use a GL.iNet Beryl AX to demonstrate both the VPN server and client setup.  
5. Terminology:  
   - **Server** = “HOME” system (where you want to pretend to be).  
   - **Client** = the device you travel with (where you actually are).  
6. LAN = Local, WAN = World.  
7. Configure **port forwarding** on your ISP’s modem/router. Use UDP port 51820.

# VPN Server – Where you want to pretend to be

1. Connect a CAT‑5e/Ethernet cable from your ISP modem/gateway/ONT to the router’s **WAN** port.  
   An easy way to remember which cable goes to what devices is look at the first letter of WAN/LAN.  
   WAN = World and therefore goes out the door (to your service provider), and LAN = Local and sticks inside the house.  
   This goes to your computer.

2. Connect another Ethernet cable from your computer to a **LAN** port on the router.  
3. Open your web browser and enter the router’s address.

## Notes

- Leave the server plugged in and connected to your ISP while you’re away.  
- Make sure whoever hosts your server has a fast internet package—fiber preferred, cable second best.  
- Speed and latency are critical for smooth VPN use.

Whether you’re in a café in Mexico, a coworking hub in Lisbon, or a mountain lodge in the Alps, this setup keeps your footprint safe while your lifestyle stays flexible.

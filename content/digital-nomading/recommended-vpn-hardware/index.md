I am a true believer in using **GL.iNet equipment** for setting up Digital Nomad VPNs. My recommendation comes from years of hands‑on experience with these devices.  

Originally, I learned how to set up a VPN server/client by searching the web — and nearly gave up when faced with overwhelming technical jargon. Eventually, I found a website that walked me through the process step by step. The very first recommendation was simple but vital: *buy the right equipment*. It sounds obvious, but many of us overlook this step. I certainly had!  

To build a reliable Nomad VPN, you’ll need at least **two devices**. You can mix and match, but the minimum recommended configuration is one home router and one travel router. Home routers deliver the best performance and should ideally serve as the “server” side of your setup. Travel routers or gateways can be used as clients, but expect lower bandwidth compared to full routers.

These are the routers and gateways I have personally used or seen in action. I can confidently recommend them for your setup. Prices vary, but that’s true of nearly all tech gear. GL.iNet offers other models too, but these are the ones I trust based on real‑world use.  

My first setup used **two Brume 2 gateways** — one as a server in the U.S. and the other as a travel client. While bandwidth was limited compared to higher‑end models, the system worked reliably. Today, most of my setups (and those I help clients with) use **Flint 3 or Flint 2** as servers, paired with a range of travel routers as clients. Your mileage may vary, but the principle remains the same: invest in solid equipment, and your VPN will reward you with stability and speed.

## Reflection

Choosing the right equipment is the foundation of a secure digital nomad lifestyle. A VPN isn’t just software — it’s hardware, reliability, and peace of mind. With the right routers, you can work from anywhere while keeping your data safe and your connection stable. For me, GL.iNet gear has been the backbone of that freedom.

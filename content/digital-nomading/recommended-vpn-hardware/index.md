I am a true believer in using GL.iNet equipment for setting up Digital Nomad VPNs.  I base this on my history with using the devices.  Originally, I did find out how to set up a VPN server/client by searching the web and letting my eyes roll into the back of my head because there was so much technical information out there.  

I found a website that walked you through the setup step by step.  The first thing that they recommened was buying the equipment you would need to actually do the job. ;)  Gee, how many of us have overlooked this vital step?  I certainly had!

You will need to buy at least 2 devices to set up the Nomad VPN.  You can mix and match things but that is the minimum number to be able to set this up in my recommended configuration. It can be 1 home router and 1 travel router, or 2 from one of the categories below.  Home routers tend to have best performance and I highly recommend them to be on the "server" side of the setup.  You CAN use a travel router or a gateway instead but the bandwidth you see will be less than

These are the routers and gateways I have personally used.  I can highly recommend that they be used in your setup.  Some cost more than others but generally that is something true about virtually anything.  They do sell other items in these categories but these are the ones I have used and/or have heard great things about.  

My initial setup was 2x Brume 2 gateways.  I used one as my server in the US and I took another with me wherever I traveled.  These have limited bandwidth capabilities compared to their siblings in the product lineup but did work.  Today, most of my and my clients setups have Flint 3 or 2 as their servers, and a range of devices as the clients.  Your mileage will vary.

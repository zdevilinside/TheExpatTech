## Miscellaneous

This section is for posts that don’t fit neatly into my other categories but still deserve a place. Think of it as a diary space—personal notes, reflections, and stories that capture moments outside the main themes of the site.  

Some entries may be lighthearted, others more thoughtful, but all of them give a glimpse into what’s happening in my life and what’s on my mind. Posts are arranged with the oldest at the end, so you can follow the journey as it unfolds.

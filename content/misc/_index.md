This section will be for posts that don't fit into my other categories but feel the need to share. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.

The layout I am going to use here is like a "diary" entry but with the oldest entries at the end.  It isn't anything that is with the main site's content so it is just a way for me to share what is going on in my life and what my thoughts are.

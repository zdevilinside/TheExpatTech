## Happy Thanksgiving!

I want to wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving.  

And while we celebrate with family, food, and traditions, here’s a fun piece of trivia about the star of the meal—the turkey.

## The Mexican Roots of the Turkey

Did you know the turkey is actually **Mexican**? Long before it became the centerpiece of American Thanksgiving, the **Aztecs domesticated the bird over 2,000 years ago**. They called it the *huexolotl* and considered it sacred.  

Unlike today’s gravy‑and‑stuffing feast, the Aztecs prepared turkey with **mole**, blending it into the rich culinary traditions of Mesoamerica.

## How It Became “American”

Spanish explorers carried the turkey from Mexico to Europe. The English, seeing similarities to birds sold by Turkish merchants, nicknamed it “turkey.” Later, Pilgrims brought the bird from Europe to Massachusetts, where it became part of colonial feasts.  

So when you sit down for Thanksgiving dinner, remember—you’re not eating a purely “Pilgrim” meal. You’re enjoying a dish with deep roots in **Mexican history and culture**.

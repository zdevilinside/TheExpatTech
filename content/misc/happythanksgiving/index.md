I want to wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving.  

Having said that, I want to share a fun piece of trivia.

Did you know that the "star" of Thanksgiving dinner, the turkey, is actually Mexican? If you think the turkey is American, you’re mistaken. The turkey is an immigrant. Mexico's Aztecs domesticated the turkey over 2,000 years ago. It was called the huexolotl. They didn’t eat it the way we do today—with gravy and stuffing. The Aztecs ate it with mole.  

So how did it become American? Like many things, Spanish explorers brought it from Mexico to Europe. The English loved it but thought it looked like a bird sold by Turkish merchants. They started calling it "turkey." The Pilgrims then brought the turkey with them from Europe to Massachusetts. That’s how the "turkey" ended up in the colonies.  

So when you sit down for Thanksgiving dinner, remember—you’re not eating a "Pilgrim" meal. You’re eating something the Aztecs once considered sacred.

I hope you have a great Thanksgiving and enjoy the meal!

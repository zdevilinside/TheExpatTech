**What working for LANL was like for me...**
*Some names may be changed to protect the innocent.  Some names may be changed to protect the guilty too.*

I have many people ask me what it was like working at LANL when they ask my background and I mention Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Well, there are some interesting things about life in Los Alamos and working at LANL that I can share.  

When I first moved to Los Alamos, my father had gotten a job at the Laboratory doing Environmental Restoration with EES Division.  I was a wayward teen who hadn't found his way yet and just lived barely getting by working in local services and restaurants.  Yeah, I wasn't applying my brain like I should but I was fighting some of my inner demons then too.  

Anyhow, while I lived in Los Alamos, I meet some really outgoing, friendly people, and some that were just like Sheldon Cooper.  Heck, in Los Alamos, *The Big Bang Theory* was reality TV!

I started finding my way and started to work at Los Alamos as a contractor in 1999.  All those people were worried about Y2K and the year 2000 bug.  I quickly did some math and realized that if we couldn't get a system compliant with the Y2K issue all we had to do was set the year to 1972 and that would be good enough to buy time to come up with a better solution.  I know a few people took this shortcut but I wasn't given credit for it.  Why would I want to have that credit?  It is just a shortcut to get us more time.  


Anyhow, after this fiasco was sorted, I was allowed to go back to work doing my job.  We, 2 other techs and myself, were put to work doing a lot of infrastructure changes including moving people to a lab-wide Active Directory deployment and a few other things.  ***Lynette***, ***Harry***, and I would work our butts off to get things done.  Under my leadership, we got to the point that we were just maintaining things instead of having to actively fix jobs.  It was a nice place to be.  

After awhile, I was chosen to move over to the old Ad Building and take over as the lead tech on the IT team that was supporting the Director, Deputy Directors, and their staffs.  However, before I did that, I had to take my replacement ***Mitch*** around to show him the contract, teach him the role, etc.  One guy, who shall remain nameless, was known to want to play around with things and was always breaking them.  I took ***Mitch*** with me to his office, found that it was a self-inflicted casualty by the guy and fixed it.  At the end, as I was going out the door, the guy asked me what was wrong with his system.  I quickly said it was a problem with the ID one zero tea at the keyboard interface.  He stated "Oh, that is what I thought" and I started walking away quickly.  Marlon caught up to me and said he couldn't believe I got away with that.  Put that together - ID 10 T....ID10T at the keyboard interface!

Another instance of fun in the job I had was another guy was known to monkey around with things not knowing what he was doing and messing things up too.  I got a ticket for him stating that his printer's control panel was in Chinese and he wanted us to fix it.  I quickly assigned myself the ticket, went to HP's website for that printer and memorized the sequence of key pushes to get to the control panel where I can change the language back to English.  I went to his office, knocked on the door and he said come in.  He was on the phone so I went directly to the printer, hit the key sequences I needed to get it back to English and started to go out the door.  The guy tells the guy on the phone to hold, and asked me what I was doing if I hadn't fixed the problem. I told him that I had and he asked how I could have done it so fast.  I couldn't help myself.  I said "Oh, I know Chinese.  It is a job requirement in IT" and quickly walked out the door.  For the next 2 weeks the guy was telling everyone that I spoke and understood Chinese.  

There were some quite serious and interesting things that I witnessed and dealt with while working at LANL though. 

I remember getting a phone call from an S-Division group leader asking me to come into the office on Saturday because they needed help finding something that was missing.  We went to the area that this missing object belonged in.  (I have to be deliberately vague here, sorry!) We moved things around and couldn't find it.  2 guys on the search team ***Dave S*** and the ***Group Leader*** (I cannot remember his name) went through offices looking for the missing thing.  We all moved desks, copiers, furniture, etc in the search but the object wasn't found.  A few days later, that "missing object" was *found* sitting on the ground behind a copier that all 3 of us moved and looked around.  Someone took something out and forgot they had it. I wish they would have acted like a grown up and owned up to their mistake.

Another serious issue was when we had DOE auditors come to look at our classified networks and computing facilities.  We had a true mess on our hands then at the laboratory.  The auditors put in their findings, and we were given the funding to do what we have been wanting to do for a long time.  We went from the worst rating on classified computing security to the best in the NNSA within a year.  

I often volunteered to do the "trained monkey" job whenever we had conferences and other major meetings.  Why?  Management wanted me there because of my capabilities.  They knew that if something went wrong, I would be one of the best people to be there to fix it quickly.  I liked going to them because I have always been fascinated with various topics.  I would pay attention to the people giving their talks and doing the "trained monkey" job of clicking for the next slide when the presenter said to do so.  I learned a lot, was fascinated by what I heard, and was surprised about how much I really already knew or the level of understanding I had on a range of topics.  

My skill level also had me assigned to various ***Special Projects*** during my time there.  The one that I felt was most interesting was when I worked on ***Project AngelFire***.  I won't go into detail about this project but it ended up with me traveling to Twenty-Nine Palms Marine Corps Base.  I was scheduled to go on vacation the following week and on Friday, just sat down with my then girlfriend for dinner at the ***Hill Diner***, when I got a phone call from ***Gary S*** telling me that he needed me in ***Palm Springs, CA*** the following week.  He asked me what he needed me to do to get me there.  I told him he needed to convince me that he needed me and then get my Group Management to agree.  He hangs up and a few minutes later I get a call from my Group Leader ***Charlie***telling me that I was needed in ***Palm Springs*** the following week.  ***Gary S*** didn't even bother to check back with me to see if it was okay for me to miss my vacation; he just expected it. 

Anyhow, my girlfriend and I went to ***Twentynine Palms, CA*** instead of to the beach in ***Puerto Penasco, Mexico*** where I took new computers, installed specialized software on them, and deployed them all over the base.  I got done with my side of the deployment faster than expected.  There were others on the team that were having difficulty and I assisted them getting their networking side fixed too.  We were a team and were told we were part of it.  The issue though is when the ***Project AngelFire*** team was awarded a Distinguished Performance Award, we were not listed as recipients.  ***Kyle*** and I were unhappy with that but it was the way the cookie crumbled.  I ended up getting a Distinguished Performance Award a few years later but was peeved about this.  I asked ***Gary S*** about us not being part of that award and never heard back from him about it.  I am not surprised though that I was considered part of the ***AngelFire*** team when they wanted us to drop everything and travel to do the work but not part of it when it came to awards time.  It doesn't surprise me to be honest.  Many of the Scientists at LANL ignore the contributions of the ***"techs"*** when it comes to anything.  A friend of mine has been a Tech at LANL since the mid-1970s.  He has gotten awards for all sorts of things.  When he has gone to various events for longevity of service at LANL, they never mention that while they do it for the scientists.  

Anyhow, I will tell you that I have met people from all walks of life while working at LANL.  Some of the people are truly amazing - ***Joe M***, ***Dan T***, ***Patrice S*** and so many more.  They could explain things to me that I didn't understand in a way that I could if I ever asked about them.  There were some rotten apples like ***Harry*** that I worked with on one of my contracts.  He always felt he was better than me, and made snide comments about me behind my back.  He doesn't know I heard about them and laugh at the thought I was such a threat to him that he had to do what he did.  

My days at LANL became numbered after I turned in my notice to my Group Leader ***Charlie***.  I did that after I received a new job offer on the east coast that was a 66% increase in pay, in a location that had a 30% lower cost of living.  I wish that was the real reason my days were numbered. I had an accident at work. This accident truly changed my life.

## A Parent’s Journey

I want to share this story as it unfolded for me.  

On October 3, 2025, I was at a friend’s house when she asked if I had a picture of my son. I didn’t have one with me, but I knew his workplace website had a photo. Pulling it up on my phone, I found his section—only to see his photo under a different name.  

Reading the bio, I discovered that my son was listed as a **trans woman**. I was floored. Driving home, I called my wife to tell her what I had seen. We thought it could be one of two things: either a marketing angle for his social work, or that he was truly transgender.

## Choosing Love First

When I got home, I sent an email immediately: *“I love you no matter what, and I support you.”*  

That’s what parenting is about. You have to love your children. Their life is theirs to live. Your beliefs may not be theirs, and nowhere does the Constitution—or basic humanity—give you the right to force your beliefs on someone else.  

The next day, my child posted on Facebook: she was a trans woman, and her name was now **Mika**.

## Family Reactions

Not everyone responded with kindness. My sister posted something negative almost immediately. The following business day, my mom—Mika’s grandmother—sent a box filled with junk mail, addressed to Mika’s old name with “Mika” awkwardly inserted in the middle. It was a cruel gesture from someone who often claimed to be progressive.  

It reminded me that sometimes people are liberal in public, but not within their own family.

## Learning and Adjusting

My daughter knows how I’m handling things and is okay with it. Before Mika told me about her transition, I referred to her by her birth name and “he.” Afterwards, I made the effort to call her **Mika** and “she.”  

I admitted to her that it would take me time to adjust—it’s hard to change habits formed over years. She told me she understood and wouldn’t hold it against me. That grace meant everything.  I was also quite concerned for her.  She lives in the redneck capitol of our state where she could be targeted.  They are NOT LGBT friendly there to say the least.  

NOTE: Before any of you roast me over the coals for the above video, I cleared it with Mika before I added it.  She said she thought it was hilarious.

## ✨ Did You Know? Family & Identity Insights

- 💬 **Names Matter** – Using someone’s chosen name is one of the simplest, most powerful ways to show respect.  
- 🧩 **Adjustment Takes Time** – Parents often need space to adapt, but effort and intention matter more than perfection.  
- 🌍 **Support Networks** – Many families find strength in social work or support groups during transitions.  
- ❤️ **Blood and Choice** – “Blood is thicker than water” is often misquoted; the original meaning emphasized chosen bonds.  
- 👪 **Generational Gaps** – Reactions often differ across generations, but empathy can bridge divides.

## Reflection

There’s a saying: *“Blood is thicker than water.”* For me, it means supporting my child no matter what. Mika’s journey is hers to live, and my role is to love her through it.  

Life brings surprises, but parenting is about choosing love, even when it challenges your assumptions. Supporting your child isn’t optional—it’s the foundation of family.

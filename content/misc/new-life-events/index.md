I am going to write this as a narrative as I found about it.

I was at a friend's house on October 3, 2025 when she asked me if I had a picture of my son.  I told her I didn't have one on me but explained that I know his work's website had one on there.  I proceeded to go there on my phone and found my son's section on it.  There was a big problem though - it was a different name with my son's photo.

I read the bio and it listed my son as a trans-woman and so much more.  I was floored and when I was driving home, I called my wife to tell her about what I saw.  We thought it was one of 2 things - he is using it as a marketing ploy for his counseling work OR that he was really transgender.  

As soon as I got home, I sent an email to him saying that I love him no matter what and I was supporting of them.  You have to love your children, and it is their life to live.  Your beliefs about something like this isn't necessarily your beliefs and there is nowhere in the Constitution that gives you the right to force your beliefs upon someone else.  

Anyhow, the next day, my son posted on his Facebook that he was a transwoman and her name is now going to be Mika.  My sister posted something really negative about it almost immediately.  The next business day, my Mom (his grandma) sent him a box with nothing but junk mail in it, addressed to his previous name with "Mika" in the middle between his first and last name.  This lady always claims she is broke, cannot afford anything, claims is a liberal, progressive but this is what she did to her own blood.  They say the message is in the form of the medium used.  We figured out that she is a liberal to everyone but her own family.  

Anyhow, my daughter knows how I am handling things and is okay with it.  Before I was told by her about her transitioning, I refer to her by her boy's name and "him".  Afterwards, I refer to her as "Mika" and "she".  I also pointed out to her that I am going to have a hard time for awhile getting those things straight because it was something I had been doing for so long - calling her by her birth name and "he".  She said she understands fully and won't hold it against me.  I am grateful for that.

Anyhow, there is a famous saying that "blood is thicker than water".  I support my daughter no matter what her choices are in life.

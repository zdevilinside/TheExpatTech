description: "Adventures in Moving - Day 1"

Moving to Mexico was a rushed endeavor for us.  We were moving down to Mexico in a used minivan that we bought just for the move.  You cannot rent a U-Haul to move across international borders.  The van we bought has cheap and the plan was to get to Mexico and then just get rid of it.  That turns out not to be something you can do.  

To say we were not properly prepared for this move is an understatement of the century.  We were basing things on what we knew about living in the United States, and from our couple of trips to Puerto Penasco, Mexico AKA Rocky Point, or, as my girlfriend at the time kept calling Pina Colada because she was drunk.  Needless to say, things changed!

The day we start our move to Mexico, we head out from Albuquerque, NM and go to my Mom and Dad's house in Las Cruces, NM.  On the way there, the "check engine" light came on and we didn't know enough about vehicles to evaluate the message.  We thought we were going to have to unload the van and move everything to our other vehicle at my Mom's house.  

My brother comes over and shows us that it isn't that big of a deal depending upon what the warning was about by showing the check engine light on his Ford Escape.  We took the truck to AutoZone and had the codes run - it had to do with an 02 sensor and wasn't that big of a deal.  What do we do?  We move things back from the car and into the van.  The car would remain at my parent's house until we can come back and get it.

Due to our stupidity, we didn't leave Las Cruces until 7pm.  We decided to drive until we got tired and then find a place to sleep.  We take off for Laredo, TX.

During the drive, we were detoured around an area where I-10 was flooded so badly that cars wer stranded in the water.  We stopped at Fort Stockton, TX to get gas and turn towards Sanderson, TX.  Angel and I had decided to continue to drive to Sanderson because we were not tired at that point.  Yeah, another mistake we made.

As we drove out of Fort Stockton, we started to see deer along the side of the road all the time.  Angel wanted to sleep but I needed her to stay awake to help me watch out for deer in the road or about to dart across it.  We would see their eyeballs light up as we drove and those big ears flapping out.  I counted at least 100 deer along the road between Ft. Stockton and Sangerson. 

I started to get really tired and decided to pull over at a little picnic area along the state highway.  Here I am sitting in the driver's seat of the minivan, unable to recline the seat because all of the stuff in the vehicle, 5 cats meowing non-stop, and my wife snoring away.  Any time I would start to nod off, a semi would fly by with so much noise it woke me up.  I just couldn't handle it and decided to continue on with the journey.  

When we arrived in Sanderson, nothing was open, not even the Stripes there.  We decided to park our van between semis and try to sleep there.  Did we get any sleep?  NOPE!  Why?  The semis left their engines idling and we just couldn't sleep because the noise.  We decide to get back on the road and stop at the first hotel that was open.  None of the hotels had vacancy in Sanderson so we continued to drive to Del Rio, TX.  

The entire was of the drive was more deer and Border Patrol trucks sitting on the side of the road with their brights on.  Every mile of the way, it was either a deer that we were afraid would jump out on the road in front of us or being blinded by the headlights of the trucks.  The trucks were so close together that they could have seen each other without their brights on but it didn't matter.  They were choosing to leave those brights on.  It was quite irrating trying to be safe while being blinded and having to be extra cautous because the deer.  

When we finally arrive at Del Rio, it was 330AM.  We found vacancy at the Motel 6 and booked a room.  We didn't tell them about the cats we had with us (I was just too tired to remember) but carried the pet carriers into the room with us so we could all get a good night's sleep.  The adventure continues the next day....

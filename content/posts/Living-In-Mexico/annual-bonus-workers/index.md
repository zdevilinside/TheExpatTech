It is that time of the year again where workers are given their yearly bonuses.  This is NOT an optional thing either.  Mexico's previous President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) completely redid the Mexico Ley de Trabajo and this is what it says now:

*Article 87.- Workers will have the right to an annual bonus that must be paid before the twentieth of December, equivalent to at least fifteen days of salary. Those who have not completed the year of service, regardless of whether they are working or not on the date of settlement of the bonus, will have the right to be paid the proportional part of it, according to the time they have worked, whatever this may be.*

The wording of the various other Articles that goes along with this rule leaves a lot to be desired but it did away with a complicated mathematical formula that was used previously.  Now though, there is a lot of "intrepretation" of the new laws and that is where it gets so confusing.

Whatever the worker earns a week, divide it by 6.  You will then get a per day amount.  You have to pay that daily amount x 15 for your annual bonus.  But then again, with the new wording, there is so much other things that can be added to it and it creates a lot of questions.  

Personally, I just pay a bonus of 2 weeks salary per year.  If my gardener works 1 day a week for $500 pesos a day, I give them $1000 as a yearly bonus.  If they earn $5000 pesos a month, I will give them $2500 pesos.  

However much you decide to pay, these bonuses need to be paid before December 20th each year.  Don't be late else you could face fines and other difficulties that you just don't want to deal with.

Good luck!

I recently had problems with my Digital Nomad VPN setup.  I went to the GL.iNet Discord and asked for help but they wanted results from various tests to be able to help me.  I provided those responses but felt there had to be a better way.
I saw these types of questions asked all the time in the tech support sub of GL.iNet's Discourd.  I found that there were very few options out there that allowed you to find a single, simple source with logs to troubleshoot a VPN network and decided to create my own.  With the assistance of "Wicked Yoda", I created these and shared them.  Wicked has taken on the torch to building these troubleshooting tools.  You can find them here:  https://github.com/wickedyoda/Network-Diag-Utilities

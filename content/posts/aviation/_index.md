I have been a fan of aviation for quite some tiome.  I remember reading all I could about various airplanes growing up.  When I was in AFJROTC as a freshman in high school, I started to memorize performance characteristics and dreamed of being a pilot.  I learned as much as I could about flying and went up every time I could.

When I went off to boarding military school, there was an aviation program there where you could learn to fly.  I took lessons there and in the mountains near home when I was on break from school.  I learned so much about aviation that I am wanting to share my knowledge with you.  I will be starting off with lists about my favorite planes, some of their performance specifications that I feel are interesting, and will end with gneeral aviation stories.  I hope you enjoy what I share here.

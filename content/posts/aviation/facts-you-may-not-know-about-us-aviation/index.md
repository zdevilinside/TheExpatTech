Throughout the 20th century, the United States has had many innovations. From Orville and Wilbur Wright's first flight at Kitty Hawk, NC to today, there have been numerous events that would not have been thought possible the generation before it.  

For me, I break down my favorite airplanes into 3 areas: World War II and before, the Cold War, and Modern Day. I know that is a small number of areas compared to the advances that aviation has undertaken during that period of time. I have to break it into those areas because I am starting to put up my website and want to generate as many stories as I can prior to that happening so there is content for everyone. Believe me when I say that this page will be undergoing ongoing updates and content additions.

The P-38 is my favorite WWII and before airplane. The twin engines and twin tails made this airframe stand out from all others. The Germans called it "der Gabelschwanz-Teufel," which is German for Fork-Tailed Devil. It was the airplane that was used to shoot down Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto during Operation Vengeance. The P-38 was the plane flown by the United States' leading ace Richard Bong, who had 40 kills. Thomas McGuire, Jr., who had 38 kills, also flew the P-38.

The SR-71 is my favorite aircraft of the Cold War. I have been a fan of the plane since I was 13 years old and heard about the capabilities of this amazing aircraft. When I first read about it, I was amazed that the plane could fly at 80,000 feet and at Mach 3. Once I read about it, I did a lot more research and found some interesting facts about it.

7. 🤓 **Ben Rich on Stealth Theory**  
   - Ben Rich, President of Lockheed Skunk Works, said Ufimtsev’s paper was so technical it required “a nerd’s nerd” to understand.

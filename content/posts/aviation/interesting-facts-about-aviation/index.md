Throughout the 20th century, the United States has have many innovations. From Orville and Wilbur Wright's first flight at Kitty Hawk, NC to today, there has been numberous events that would not have been thought possible the generation before.  

For me, I break down my favorite airplanes into 3 areas: World War II and before, the Cold War, and Modern Day. I know that is a small number of areas compared to the advances that aviation has undertaken during that period of time. I have to break it into those areas because I am starting to put up my website and want to generate as many stories as I can prior to that happening so there is content for everyone. Believe me when I say that this page will be undergoing ongoing updates and content additions.

The P-38 is my favorite WWII and before airplane. The twin engine and tails made this airframe stand out from all others. The Germans called it "der Gabelschwanz-Teufel" which is German for Fork Tailed Devil. It was the airplane that was used to shoot down Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto during Operation Vengeance. The P-38 was the plane flown by the United States' leading ace Richard Bong who had 40 kills. Thomas McGuire, Jr. had 38 kills also flew the P-38.

The SR-71 is my favorite aircraft of the Cold War. I have been a fan of the plane since I was 13 years old and heard about the capabilities of this amazing plane. When I first read about it, I was amazed that the plane could fly at 80,000 feet and at Mach 3. Once I read about it, I did a lot more research about the plane and found some interesting facts about it. 

# Now to the Interesting Facts!

1. Did you know that the SR-71 was a follow on to the OXCART built by the CIA and was also known as the A-12?  
2. The A-12 was the 12th version of the design. Previous designs were named A-1, A-2, etc.  
3. The A-12 was designed by aviation's legendary Kelly Johnson and Lockheed.  
4. There have been over 4000 missiles fired at it all told and NONE have been able to shoot it down.  
5. An A-12, Article 129, 60-6932 was damaged over North Korea when it ran into SA-2 SAM debris. This damage was discovered after landing and was undergoing an after-flight check.

description: "Amazing facts about the SR-71"
---


The SR-71 is my favorite aircraft. I have been a fan of the plane since I was 13 years old and heard about the capabilities of this amazing plane. When I first read about it, I was amazed that the plane could fly at 80,000 feet and at Mach 3. Once I read about it, I did a lot more research about the plane and found some interesting facts about it.

1. Did you know that the SR-71 was a follow on to the OXCART built by the CIA and was also known as the A-12?  
2. The A-12 was the 12th version of the design. Previous designs were named A-1, A-2, etc.  
3. The A-12 was designed by aviation's legendary Kelly Johnson and Lockheed.  
4. There have been over 4000 missiles fired at it all told and NONE have been able to shoot it down.  
5. An A-12, Article 129, 60-6932 was damaged over North Korea when it ran into SA-2 SAM debris. This damage was discovered after landing and was undergoing an after-flight check.  
6. David Peters once flew a SR-71 at Mach 3.48 after an unusual weather pattern led to cooler air over the flight path than normal.  
7. Brian Shul was the only pilot ever to be kicked out of the SR-71 program. SOURCE: http://www.arcforums.com/forums/air/index.php?/topic/267042-brian-shul-and-the-sr-71/  
8. Brian Shul's "LA Speed Story" isn't real. The SR-71 didn't have radios that would have been able to talk on the frequency he claimed he was using.  

And on, and on, and on....

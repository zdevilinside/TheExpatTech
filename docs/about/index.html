    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Hi everyone! I’ve been working in IT for a long time—my first experiences go all the way back to playing on Apple IIe computers in 1983. One of the first “skills” I picked up was learning how to turn single-sided, double-density 5.25” floppy disks into double-sided disks using nothing more than a hole punch. I’ll also admit that I got into BBSes mainly so I could download games over a 300-baud modem.</p>
<p>On my birthday in 1990, a friend gave me the game <em>B-17 Flying Fortress</em>. I told him my computer wasn’t powerful enough to run it and suggested we keep it at his house so I could play it there. He told me I should just build a new computer. I said I had no idea how. He said he would teach me. And that was the start of everything.</p>
<p>The first computer I ever built was a 286 running at 12 MHz, with 4 MB of SIPP memory, both 3.5” and 5.25” floppy drives, CGA graphics, and a massive (for the time) 250 MB Western Digital hard drive. It ran MS-DOS 3.3.</p>
<p>We held LAN parties at his house using LapLink cables to connect our systems through the parallel port. His brother, who worked as a computer tech at a laboratory, couldn’t believe we were transferring data at 115.2K baud. We showed him how it worked—and he later implemented it at his job because it was so effective.</p>
<p>I worked and saved up money to upgrade my system piece by piece. Motherboards, CPUs, video cards, RAM, and hard drives all came and went as I could afford better hardware. When I went back to school, my grant money covered tuition, and anything left over went straight toward computer upgrades. I still remember people being shocked that I had 32 MB of RAM in my Pentium 120 system.</p>
<p>As time went on, I started doing more work for businesses, AOL, and anyone who needed IT support. Eventually, I became a level-3 technician at a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory, specializing in Windows, Macintosh, and Linux systems. Level 1 handled phones, Level 2 handled field work—and when they couldn’t fix an issue, they sent me. I stayed with the problem until it was resolved.</p>
<p>After a workplace injury left me out of work for six months, I decided to keep a promise I made to my father: to get as much education as I could before he passed. I earned an associate degree, then a bachelor’s, and then a master’s. Along the way, I discovered how much I enjoy learning. Since then, I’ve continued taking online and night classes every term. I’ve earned two more master’s degrees and am currently taking at least two courses each term—simply because I enjoy learning new things. I’m also only a few classes away from earning yet another master’s degree. I guess you could say I still don’t know what I want to be when I grow up. 😉</p>
<p>This site will be a place where I post about my interests. I love computers, aviation, music, and movies/TV shows. Most of the content will focus on computers, with occasional posts about everything else.</p>
<p>Welcome to my world!</p>

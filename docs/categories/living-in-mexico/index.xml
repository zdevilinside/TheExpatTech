It’s not as simple as moving south and staying on a tourist visa. The &lt;strong&gt;FMM (tourist card)&lt;/strong&gt; is increasingly monitored, and INM (Mexican Immigration) now networks its systems to track repeat entries. Those days of “border hopping” are rapidly ending.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is &lt;strong&gt;not optional&lt;/strong&gt;—it is mandated by law.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-the-law-says&#34;&gt;What the Law Says&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;strong&gt;Article 87 of the Federal Labor Law&lt;/strong&gt;, all employees must receive an annual bonus equivalent to at least &lt;strong&gt;15 days of salary&lt;/strong&gt;, paid no later than &lt;strong&gt;December 20th&lt;/strong&gt;. Even employees who have not completed a full year of service are entitled to a proportional payment based on the time they have worked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Misadventures in Moving - Day 3</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We woke up late the next morning, and I immediately got on my laptop to contact a friend from boarding school who lived in Mexico City. Pedro gave me some invaluable tips for the rest of our trip: always tip attendants about 10 pesos when they fill your gas tank (Mexico is a &lt;strong&gt;full‑service country&lt;/strong&gt; where you cannot pump your own gas), and use a &lt;em&gt;casa de cambio&lt;/em&gt; to exchange U.S. dollars for pesos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We woke up late the next morning—closer to 11 a.m. than the 9 a.m. departure we had planned. Exhaustion had caught up with us. I quietly snuck the cats back into the van, and we set off once more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-ac-fiasco&#34;&gt;The AC Fiasco&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we pulled away, I realized the air conditioner wasn’t blowing cold. I had just put freon in the system before leaving Albuquerque! Back in the Motel 6 parking lot, I popped the hood and discovered my mistake: I had forgotten to replace the cap on the line, so all the freon had leaked out overnight. A rookie error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Misadventures in Moving - Day 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moving to Mexico was a rushed endeavor for us. We were heading south in a used minivan we bought specifically for the move. You can’t rent a U‑Haul to cross international borders, so the van seemed like the simplest solution. It was cheap, and the plan was to get rid of it once we arrived in Mexico. That turned out not to be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To say we were unprepared is the understatement of the century. We based our expectations on what we knew from living in the United States and from a couple of short trips to Puerto Peñasco, Mexico (better known as Rocky Point). My girlfriend at the time jokingly called it “Pina Colada” because she was drunk during one of those trips. Needless to say, reality was very different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How and why I moved to Mexico?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got in my van and drove there! ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, seriously. I really didn’t have much of a choice. In my case, I had just returned from a failed attempt to start school in Germany. We were in a tough spot—we had already sold our house, needed somewhere to live for six months, and had to survive on a student’s budget. The place had to be inexpensive, have reliable internet, and be near a major international airport.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

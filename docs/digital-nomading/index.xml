      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a true believer in using GL.iNet equipment for setting up Digital Nomad VPNs.  I base this on my history with using the devices.  Originally, I did find out how to set up a VPN server/client by searching the web and letting my eyes roll into the back of my head because there was so much technical information out there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found a website that walked you through the setup step by step.  The first thing that they recommened was buying the equipment you would need to actually do the job. ;)  Gee, how many of us have overlooked this vital step?  I certainly had!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is a Digital Nomad VPN?</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;digital-nomad-vpn-guide&#34;&gt;Digital Nomad VPN Guide&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start this off with a few explanations so you can better understand some basic concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, think of the Internet as a giant map. There are addresses where you can access specific things, and only those addresses. To reach them, you type in something like &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.IDontWantToBeHere.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreffer &#34;&gt;www.IDontWantToBeHere.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (I don’t think that site actually exists) and hit enter in your web browser. Most people don’t know how that actually works. Your Internet provider takes that website’s URL and looks it up in a “phone book” until it finds a “phone number” used to dial that location. When you enter that address, the phone book shows the address &lt;em&gt;127.0.0.1&lt;/em&gt; and dials that number. It’s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Becoming a Digital Nomad</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You’re feeling wanderlust. Your job is online, so you realize you can start working from anywhere. You decide to give it a try. You research the rules and requirements for traveling the world while working remotely — and that’s how the journey begins. This site explains &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; path down that rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my case, it came about as a necessity. I was on my way to graduate school in Germany when illness cut those plans short. Looking for alternatives, I researched the best places to live for six months before trying again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Welcome to my world</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;well-what-is-this-site&#34;&gt;Well, what is this site?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to create a place where I can share the things I enjoy, the things I know well, and the things I’ve spent a lifetime immersed in. I know a lot about computers. I’m an American who lives part-time in Mexico, part-time in the U.S., and part-time all over the world. I’ve worked professionally as an IT technician for over three decades. I also know quite a bit about how to entertain yourself if you&amp;rsquo;re an indoor person who likes movies and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I became a digital nomad?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was on my way to graduate school in Germany back in 2015.  I got as far as Amsterdam when I ended up being hospitalized for 15 days.  7 days in was when graduate school started.  The Germans wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me have a late start so I had to return to the US.  We had already sold our house by then so I needed to move somewhere fast.  My requirements were that the place was inexpensive, had great internet service, was near a major international airport, and that &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;snow&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; was a foreign language and the only ice you got was in your drink.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

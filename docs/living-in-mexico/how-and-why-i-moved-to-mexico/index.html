      <p>I got in my van and drove there! ;)</p>
<p>Okay, I will be serious.  I really didn&rsquo;t have a choice but to move.  In my case, I had just come home from a failed attempt to start school in Germany.  We were in a bad situation - we had sold our house already, needed to move to somewhere for 6 months and live on a student&rsquo;s budget.  We needed to have good Internet, be near a major international airport, and inexpensive.</p>
<p>I went online and started looking at places that were inexpensive to live and had a good Internet infrastructure.  I visited the Expats in Mexico group on Facebook and asked for that information along with other Expat groups I found around the world.  I asked the questions I needed to ask and read through the replies.  One comment got my attention.  Peo Lekare posted a Speedtest result for his ISP in Cuernavaca, Mexico.  It was faster than what I was able to get in Albuquerque, NM.  I messaged him asking for more information.  He provided information on costs, how close it was to Mexico City, and many more details.</p>
<p>We continued to talk and after awhile, he convinced us that we should move there.  My wife and I decided that it was our only option that made any sense.  We continued down that path and made preperations to move.  Peo, Fabiola (his wife), and children all helped us with the decision making we had to do.  They did &ldquo;House Hunters International&rdquo; for us by going to places, recording video of the various places, and giving us their impressions.  After a few visits, we found the place we wanted.  They started doing the paperwork for us and the owner of the property through a monkeywrench in at the last second; he wanted the title of our vehcile to hold against us as a rental deposit.  This was actually illegal to do in Mexico but the owner didn&rsquo;t care.  We immediately backed out of the deal 10 days before we were to move.</p>
<p>Peo and his family went all out to find us a new place.  They found another place we liked but there was one big problem; the owner wanted the money <em>NOW</em> to save the home for us.  Going against our better judgements, we went ahead and sent the money to Peo to put down on the house.  They paid the deposit and first month&rsquo;s rent for us.  We were 8 days away from moving to Cuernavaca.</p>
<p>2 days later, Peo sent me a message.  He stated he got a new job in Playa del Carmen and needed to start the next week.  He had to move immediately.  Angel and I started to immediately think that we were scammed but we had already committed to the move.  We had no choice to proceed.  We would deal with things as they come to us in our move.</p>

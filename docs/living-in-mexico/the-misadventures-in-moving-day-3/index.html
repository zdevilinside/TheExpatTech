    <div class="content">
      <p>We woke up late the next morning, and I immediately got on my laptop to contact a friend from boarding school who lived in Mexico City. Pedro gave me some invaluable tips for the rest of our trip: always tip attendants about 10 pesos when they fill your gas tank (Mexico is a <strong>full‑service country</strong> where you cannot pump your own gas), and use a <em>casa de cambio</em> to exchange U.S. dollars for pesos.</p>
<p>We had assumed, based on outdated advice, that U.S. dollars were still widely accepted. Nope. Mexico had implemented new rules to combat money laundering. Pedro’s guidance saved us from a major headache. We found a money exchange on the map, programmed it into Angel’s GPS, and set off.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="verizon-woes-and-language-barriers">Verizon Woes and Language Barriers</h2>
<p>Did I mention we were using our U.S. Verizon service for this trip? Our SIM cards didn’t work in Mexico. We relied on Wi‑Fi to download maps and directions. At the <em>casa de cambio</em>, our limited Spanish made things difficult. It took us 15 minutes of wandering before we found the right place. Still, we managed to exchange money and continue on our way.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="scenic-drive-and-mexico-city-traffic">Scenic Drive and Mexico City Traffic</h2>
<p>Driving through Mexico reminded me of New Mexico—high desert terrain giving way to mountains. The scenery was beautiful, and the drive was pleasant. We made good time, arriving in the Mexico City area around 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Pedro and his wife had given us the contact information for the real estate agent handling our rental in Cuernavaca. The email, written entirely in Spanish, said that if we arrived by 10 p.m., she would let us into the house. If later, we’d need to get a hotel and meet her in the morning.</p>
<p>Traffic in Mexico City was brutal. Stuck in the left lane, Angel’s GPS suddenly told us to exit right immediately. Nobody let us over. I decided to take the next exit and circle back. Surprisingly, it worked. We even stopped at Burger King for dinner and got back on track within 45 minutes.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="gridlock-and-monsoon-rains">Gridlock and Monsoon Rains</h2>
<p>By 9 p.m., the GPS showed we were on track to reach Cuernavaca. Then traffic came to a complete stop. For 1.5 hours, we crawled forward 100 feet at a time. Eventually, we discovered the cause: construction of a new elevated expressway.</p>
<p>As we finally picked up speed, the skies opened. It was monsoon season, and rain poured in buckets. With few streetlights, the highway was pitch‑black. Driving up the mountainside toward Cuernavaca felt like navigating through a blizzard—visibility was minimal, and tension was high.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lost-in-cuernavaca">Lost in Cuernavaca</h2>
<p>The rain stopped as we crested the mountain, revealing a forested area. We knew we’d arrive after 11 p.m. I decided to test my memory and found the house easily. Angel insisted we find a hotel instead. But with no working phones, poor Spanish, and dim hotel signage, we drove in circles. Plaza Cuernavaca and Sears became familiar landmarks as we searched in vain.</p>
<p>At a 7‑Eleven, I asked two police officers for help. Showing them the realtor’s email, I asked, “¿Dónde es hotel?” One officer looked at me strangely, then called someone. His tone grew angrier as the conversation went on. After hanging up, he and his partner threw away their food, pointed at me, and said, “Follow!”</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="escorted-home">Escorted Home</h2>
<p>In the pouring rain, one officer led on a motorcycle while the other followed behind us. I told Angel that if things got sketchy, I’d floor it and escape. But as we followed, I recognized landmarks. Soon, we were at the Costco across from our new neighborhood.</p>
<p>The officers pulled into the gated community and arranged for the realtor to let us in—at 1 a.m.! I tried to pay them for the food they had discarded, but they refused. The realtor arrived, clearly unhappy, but opened the house. We unloaded what we could and collapsed into bed.</p>
<p>The next morning, we met the realtor again. She brought her daughter, who spoke some English. The daughter explained what had happened: when the officer called, he told the realtor to get out of bed and let us in immediately—or he would arrest her. We were shocked, embarrassed, and amused all at once.</p>

<h2 id="-did-you-know-moving-to-mexico-insights">✨ Did You Know? Moving to Mexico Insights</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>⛽ <strong>Full Service Gas Stations</strong><br>
In Mexico, attendants pump your gas, check fluids, and often clean your windshield. Tipping is customary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>💵 <strong>Currency Exchange Rules</strong><br>
U.S. dollars are no longer widely accepted for everyday transactions. Casas de cambio are essential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🚓 <strong>Police Lights Always On</strong><br>
Mexican police cars often drive with flashing lights, which can confuse newcomers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🌧️ <strong>Monsoon Season Hazards</strong><br>
Heavy rains and poor lighting make night driving in Mexico especially challenging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🏘️ <strong>Fraccionamientos</strong><br>
Gated communities (<em>fraccs</em>) are common in Mexico, offering added security but requiring paperwork and coordination.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>Day 3 was the climax of our misadventures: currency confusion, gridlock, monsoon rains, and a surreal police escort. What felt chaotic at the time became a story we still laugh about. Despite being unprepared, unable to speak the language well, and without working phones, we made it to our new home.</p>
<p>This was the end of the move—but only the beginning of our life in Mexico. The misadventures taught us resilience, humility, and the importance of community. What started as a rushed, ill‑prepared journey became the foundation for a new chapter abroad.</p>

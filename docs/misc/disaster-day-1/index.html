      <h2 id="disaster-strikes">Disaster Strikes</h2>
<p><em>Some names have been changed to protect both the innocent and the guilty.</em></p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-fall">The Fall</h3>
<p>A major snowstorm hit northern New Mexico in February. Government offices and schools closed everywhere—except at the Lab. We were given only a two‑hour delay. I went to my old office in the Ad Building to retrieve information my team lead, <em><strong>Denise</strong></em>, insisted only I had.</p>
<p>After passing through the booth and going “behind the fence,” I found the parking lot coated in solid ice. Wearing YakTrax, I shuffled carefully in a “penguin walk.” Even so, I slipped and fell hard. My left leg and right arm were trapped beneath me: I dislocated my left ankle, breaking both the tibia and fibula, and fractured my right radial head (elbow).</p>
<p>Someone rushed over and told me to stay down. Only then did I realize how badly I was hurt. Another person rushed inside to call 911. Lying on the ice, I grew cold and instinctively rolled to my side, using my good limbs to cushion the injured ones—an old Army habit. But the cold seeped in no matter how I positioned myself. With help, I crawled to a nearby SUV, was assisted standing up, and stood there gripping the truck&rsquo;s spare tire, and waited until the ambulance arrived.</p>
<p>The ice was so treacherous that even two firefighters fell as they stepped off their engine, one reportedly broke his tailbone. They rolled a stretcher to me, helped me sit, then eased me down and transported me to Los Alamos Medical Center (LAMC). I knew the damage was severe when I heard the paramedic call in: “Deformed left ankle.” My heart sank.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="emergency-room-chaos">Emergency Room Chaos</h3>
<p>At the ER, everything was frantic. I asked staff to call the only person I could think of: my friend <em><strong>Frank</strong></em>. Later he told me he received a chilling message at work: <em>“This is Los Alamos Medical Center. You are needed in the Emergency Room immediately.”</em></p>
<p>While I waited for <em><strong>Frank</strong></em>, my Group Leader <em><strong>Charlie</strong></em> arrived. But when doctors began asking personal health questions, I felt uncomfortable with him listening. He didn’t take the hint to leave until <em><strong>Frank</strong></em> arrived and convinced him to step out.</p>
<p>I was grateful <em><strong>Frank</strong></em> stayed. When a nurse handed me pain medication, he asked what it was. As soon as I heard “Percocet,” I spat it out—I’m allergic. My records clearly noted the allergy, but they still tried to give it to me. <em><strong>THANK YOU FRANK!</strong></em> He also insisted they x‑ray my arm after only scanning my leg. Without that, they would have sent me home on crutches, unaware my elbow was fractured.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="family-in-crisis">Family in Crisis</h3>
<p>I was a single parent of a 12‑year‑old boy. Admitted to the hospital, I panicked: who would care for him? I thought of calling my girlfriend, but I didn’t know her new cell number; we got her a new phone and number the weekend before but it was saved in my phone back at the office. So I called my mother in Las Cruces, 320 miles away. She immediately agreed to drive up.</p>
<p>While waiting, I phoned my son’s school principal to explain the situation and that Grandma was on her way. Unfortunately, staff told him abruptly to report to the principal’s office. Like any 12‑year‑old, he feared he was in trouble. When finally called in, they began with, “Your dad was in an accident at work…” That was all he heard. He burst into tears.</p>
<p>Distraught, he came home shaken. We spoke briefly by phone, but I was groggy from pain meds. I was on NPO status—no food or drink—awaiting surgery.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="more-misfortune">More Misfortune</h3>
<p>When my mother arrived, she saw how upset my son was and decided to take him to the hospital. On the way, her car got stuck in the snow. They agreed to walk home and wait until morning. But as they walked, she slipped on ice and broke her ankle too.</p>
<p>The next morning, <em><strong>Frank</strong></em> drove her and my son to the hospital. She told me my sister was coming from Albuquerque to take them back to Las Cruces. Drugged as I was, I didn’t grasp how serious her injury was if she was leaving her car behind.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="pain-and-fog">Pain and Fog</h3>
<p>I continued receiving pain meds every few hours, only enough liquid to swallow pills, as I awaited surgery. While my mom, <em><strong>Frank</strong></em>, and my son visited, my team lead <em><strong>Denise</strong></em> arrived with <em><strong>Charlie</strong></em>. As they left, <em><strong>Denise</strong></em> tried to reassure me by tapping my foot—unfortunately, the broken one. My scream echoed as far away as the lobby.</p>
<p>After that, everything blurred. The hospital kept trying to reach on‑call surgeons but failed. I was heavily medicated. Later, <em><strong>Steve W</strong></em> told me he had called to check on me. When he asked how I was, I replied “green.” He asked again, and I said “purple.” He hung up, saying he’d call later. I only know this because he and <em><strong>Frank</strong></em> recounted it to me afterward.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="friends-step-in">Friends Step In</h3>
<p>After being in NPO status for 2 day, friends started calling the Lab’s Occupational Medicine office and the hospital, demanding action but none came. One friend, <em><strong>Lo</strong></em>, took desparate action.  She contacted DOE Headquarters in Washington, D.C., pleading for help. LANL’s contract required DOE Headquarters be notified of any workplace accident resulting in hospitalization within four hours. In my case, three days had passed without notification.</p>
<p>A few hours after <em><strong>Lo</strong></em>’s call, the LANL Occ Med Group Leader visited me at the hospital. <em><strong>Laura</strong></em>, before leaving, asked me to tell my friends to stop calling—they were “on it” now.  They were going to get me moved to Las Cruces where I had a support system in place and wouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about how I was going to live during my recovery.</p>

<b>Well, what is this site?</b>
<br>
<br>
Over the years, I have shared stories from my past.  I often got told that I should write a book about about my life.  I would comment back: <blockquote>"Yeah, if I wrote a book about my life, it would be a #1 best seller - as a horror novel! </blockquote>
<br>
Well, I never got around to writing that book but here I am to write about it in a website that you can enjoy.  
<br>
<br>
I want to create a place where I can share the things I enjoy, the things I know well, and the things I’ve spent a lifetime immersed in. I know a lot about computers. I’m an American who lives part-time in Mexico, part-time in the U.S., and part-time all over the world. I’ve worked professionally as an IT technician for over three decades. I also know quite a bit about how to entertain yourself if you're an indoor person who likes movies and TV shows.
<br>
<br>
<b>So what does all of this mean?</b>  
<p></p>
It means this website will be divided into three main sections:
<ul>
<li><b>Living in Mexico</b> – how to do it legally, the processes involved, and helpful tips I’ve learned along the way.</li>
<li><b>Computers & Technology</b> – sharing what I know in the hope that you’ll find something useful.</li>
<li><b>Digital Nomading</b> – advice, recommendations, and insights into how to do it successfully. I’ll tell you this, though: being a digital nomad is not easy.</li>
<li><b>Aviation</b> - This is something that has been a passion for me for quite some time.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>What is my background?</b>
<br><br>
Do you remember that kid in school who was always the new student and seemed a bit odd?
<br><br>
Yep—that was me.
<br><br>
Every summer, my family moved far enough away that I never stayed in one place long enough to form lasting friendships. This was before the age of the dinosaurs… err… before the Internet. Keeping in touch was difficult when long-distance calls were expensive, and my family couldn’t afford them for years. By the time we could, I had already learned that making friends felt pointless—I’d just be saying goodbye again the next summer.
<br><br>
<i><b>But isolation can have its advantages.</b></i>
<br><br>
After my mom met my stepdad (whom I called Dad), I ended up with a computer in my room. Back then, only about one in eight households even had a computer. We had an Apple IIe in the den, and I had an Apple IIc in my bedroom. I began to live and breathe computers. I used a dial-up modem to connect to BBSs and downloaded games like *Summer Games*, *Ultima IV*, and *Autoduel*.
<br><br>
When I turned 18, a friend gave me **B-17 Flying Fortress** for my birthday. I told him we should leave it at his house because my computer wasn’t powerful enough to run it. He asked why I didn’t just build a better system. My answer: “I don’t know how to build a computer.”
<br><br>
So Burt taught me—and that lit a fire in me that has never gone out.
<br><br>
Over the years, I built computers for friends and family. I built so many that it eventually turned into my first business. My skills grew, and I became a technician doing installs, troubleshooting, and repairs. I worked for AOL in Albuquerque, NM, and later for a U.S. government contractor supplying Dell computers to one of the National Laboratories. Through a few connections, I ended up doing desktop support at the Lab as a contractor.
<br><br>
I did the job well enough that the University of California hired me full-time at **Los Alamos National Laboratory**—yes, the home of the atomic bomb. People who live and work there either stink or glow in the dark. Turn off the lights and you’ll figure out which one I am.
<br><br>
I left LANL a few years ago to go back to school. When I graduated from military boarding school, I had a scholarship to attend the college of my choice. Instead, I joined the U.S. Army—a choice I later felt disappointed my father.
<br><br>
A saying of his stayed with me:
<br><br>
<blockquote>“A job can be taken away from you, but your education cannot.”</blockquote>
<br>
It hit me like a two-ton heavy thing.
<br><br>
When my dad’s health declined, I decided to give school another try and promised him I would pursue as much education as I could. He lived to see me earn an Associate of Applied Science, a Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology, and a Master of Science in IT. After he passed away, I realized I actually enjoyed school—so I kept going. I earned two more master’s degrees, and today I still take one or two courses each term in whatever subjects interest me.
<br><br>
My view on life now is:
<br><br>
<blockquote>“If you aren’t learning something new each day, you’re not trying anymore. Get your head out of the sand, look around, and do something different!”</blockquote>
<br><br>
My life today looks very different from just a few years ago. I’ve learned that living life isn’t just about doing your job—it’s about expanding your horizons and constantly learning.
<br><br>
I hope you like this site. I’ll organize things by subject. Some topics will overlap between sections, but many will be unique to their own area. If there’s anything you want me to explain more clearly, or a topic you’d like my perspective on, just let me know.

<p>Okay, I will be serious.  I really didn&rsquo;t have a choice but to move.  In my case, I had just come home from a failed attempt to start school in Germany.  We were in a bad situation - we had sold our house already, needed to move to somewhere for 6 months and live on a student&rsquo;s budget.  We needed to have good Internet, be near a major international airport, and inexpensive.</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>Many people do not know this but there were 2 aircraft named the Blackbird.  The first, the A-12 was built by the CIA, was a single seat reconnaissance airplane.  It was designated the A-12 because it was the 12 in a series of designs for the “Archangel” program.  Archangel was the aircraft’s code name.<br>

Lockheed and Convair were in competition to build a replacement for the U-2.  They were trying to lower the radar cross section of the U-2 because it was so easily detected by the Soviet Union.  At first, the CIA preferred the Convair Kingfisher program but the A-12’s specifications were a little better and its cost was much lower.  Further, the companies track records were a factor; Convair had built the B-58 Hustler that had been plagued by delays and cost overruns.  Lockheed had produced the U-2 on time and under budget.<br>
The A-12 was built between 1962 and 1964.  It flew from 1963 until 1968.  The plane was the precursor to the SR-71 Blackbird, the M-21 launcher for the D-21 drone, and the YF-12 prototype.  Its was originally designed to fly over Cuba and the Soviet Union but that plan was tossed away after Gary Powers was shot down.<br>

<b>Well, what is this site?</b>
<br>
<br>
Over the years, I have shared stories from my past.  I often got told that I should write a book about about my life.  I would comment back: <blockquote>"Yeah, if I wrote a book about my life, it would be a #1 best seller - as a horror novel! </blockquote>
<br>
Well, I never got around to writing that book but here I am to write about it in a website that you can enjoy.  
<br>
<br>
I want to create a place where I can share the things I enjoy, the things I know well, and the things I’ve spent a lifetime immersed in. I know a lot about computers. I’m an American who lives part-time in Mexico, part-time in the U.S., and part-time all over the world. I’ve worked professionally as an IT technician for over three decades. I also know quite a bit about how to entertain yourself if you're an indoor person who likes movies and TV shows.
<br>
<br>
<b>So what does all of this mean?</b>  
<p></p>
It means this website will be divided into three main sections:
<ul>
<li><b>Living in Mexico</b> – how to do it legally, the processes involved, and helpful tips I’ve learned along the way.</li>
<li><b>Computers & Technology</b> – sharing what I know in the hope that you’ll find something useful.</li>
<li><b>Digital Nomading</b> – advice, recommendations, and insights into how to do it successfully. I’ll tell you this, though: being a digital nomad is not easy.</li>
<li><b>Aviation</b> - This is something that has been a passion for me for quite some time.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>What is my background?</b>
<br><br>
Do you remember that kid in school who was always the new student and seemed a bit odd?
<br><br>
Yep—that was me.
<br><br>
Every summer, my family moved far enough away that I never stayed in one place long enough to form lasting friendships. This was before the age of the dinosaurs… err… before the Internet. Keeping in touch was difficult when long-distance calls were expensive, and my family couldn’t afford them for years. By the time we could, I had already learned that making friends felt pointless—I’d just be saying goodbye again the next summer.
<br><br>
<i><b>But isolation can have its advantages.</b></i>
<br><br>
After my mom met my stepdad (whom I called Dad), I ended up with a computer in my room. Back then, only about one in eight households even had a computer. We had an Apple IIe in the den, and I had an Apple IIc in my bedroom. I began to live and breathe computers. I used a dial-up modem to connect to BBSs and downloaded games like *Summer Games*, *Ultima IV*, and *Autoduel*.
<br><br>
When I turned 18, a friend gave me **B-17 Flying Fortress** for my birthday. I told him we should leave it at his house because my computer wasn’t powerful enough to run it. He asked why I didn’t just build a better system. My answer: “I don’t know how to build a computer.”
<br><br>
So Burt taught me—and that lit a fire in me that has never gone out.
<br><br>
Over the years, I built computers for friends and family. I built so many that it eventually turned into my first business. My skills grew, and I became a technician doing installs, troubleshooting, and repairs. I worked for AOL in Albuquerque, NM, and later for a U.S. government contractor supplying Dell computers to one of the National Laboratories. Through a few connections, I ended up doing desktop support at the Lab as a contractor.
<br><br>
I did the job well enough that the University of California hired me full-time at **Los Alamos National Laboratory**—yes, the home of the atomic bomb. People who live and work there either stink or glow in the dark. Turn off the lights and you’ll figure out which one I am.
<br><br>
I left LANL a few years ago to go back to school. When I graduated from military boarding school, I had a scholarship to attend the college of my choice. Instead, I joined the U.S. Army—a choice I later felt disappointed my father.
<br><br>
A saying of his stayed with me:
<br><br>
<blockquote>“A job can be taken away from you, but your education cannot.”</blockquote>
<br>
It hit me like a two-ton heavy thing.
<br><br>
When my dad’s health declined, I decided to give school another try and promised him I would pursue as much education as I could. He lived to see me earn an Associate of Applied Science, a Bachelor of Information and Communication Technology, and a Master of Science in IT. After he passed away, I realized I actually enjoyed school—so I kept going. I earned two more master’s degrees, and today I still take one or two courses each term in whatever subjects interest me.
<br><br>
My view on life now is:
<br><br>
<blockquote>“If you aren’t learning something new each day, you’re not trying anymore. Get your head out of the sand, look around, and do something different!”</blockquote>
<br><br>
My life today looks very different from just a few years ago. I’ve learned that living life isn’t just about doing your job—it’s about expanding your horizons and constantly learning.
<br><br>
I hope you like this site. I’ll organize things by subject. Some topics will overlap between sections, but many will be unique to their own area. If there’s anything you want me to explain more clearly, or a topic you’d like my perspective on, just let me know.

<p>Lockheed’s Skunk Works developed a family of high-speed reconnaissance and interceptor aircraft in the 1960s.<br>
The <strong>A‑12</strong>, <strong>YF‑12</strong>, and <strong>SR‑71 Blackbird</strong> share a common lineage but differ in mission, configuration, and performance.<br>

<p>The A-12 was the clandestine forerunner of the SR-71 Blackbird.  The airframes are nearly the same shape and have similar dimensions.  While the SR-71 holds many records for a manned jet aircraft, the A-12 wflew higher and faster than the its sibling because its existence was classified for over 20 years.</p></div><div class="post-footer">

Dipshit Farmers had gone to Mexico before but they took US dollars and we thought it was that way still.  NOPE!  Mexico implemented new rules that was intended to stop money-laundering.

I have been a fan of the plane since I was 13 years old and heard about the capabilities of this amazing plane. When I first read about it, I was amazed that the plane could fly at 80,000 feet and at Mach 3. Once I read about it, I did a lot more research about the plane and found some interesting facts about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SR-71 Specifications</title><link>https://zdevilinside.github.io/TheExpatTech/posts/aviation/sr-71-specifications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>ZDevilInside</author><guid>https://zdevilinside.github.io/TheExpatTech/posts/aviation/sr-71-specifications/</guid><description><![CDATA[<h1 id="general-characteristics">General Characteristics</h1>

<p>Many people do not know this but there were 2 aircraft named the Blackbird.  The first, the A-12 was built by the CIA, was a single seat reconnaissance airplane.  It was designated the A-12 because it was the 12 in a series of designs for the “Archangel” program.  Archangel was the aircraft’s code name.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Lockheed and Convair were in competition to build a replacement for the U-2.  They were trying to lower the radar cross section of the U-2 because it was so easily detected by the Soviet Union.  At first, the CIA preferred the Convair Kingfisher program but the A-12’s specifications were a little better and its cost was much lower.  Further, the companies track records were a factor; Convair had built the B-58 Hustler that had been plagued by delays and cost overruns.  Lockheed had produced the U-2 on time and under budget.<br>
The A-12 was built between 1962 and 1964.  It flew from 1963 until 1968.  The plane was the precursor to the SR-71 Blackbird, the M-21 launcher for the D-21 drone, and the YF-12 prototype.  Its was originally designed to fly over Cuba and the Soviet Union but that plan was tossed away after Gary Powers was shot down.<br>

<p>Lockheed’s Skunk Works developed a family of high-speed reconnaissance and interceptor aircraft in the 1960s.<br>
The <strong>A‑12</strong>, <strong>YF‑12</strong>, and <strong>SR‑71 Blackbird</strong> share a common lineage but differ in mission, configuration, and performance.<br>
</p>
<h1 id="a-12">A-12</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The A-12 was the clandestine forerunner of the SR-71 Blackbird.  The airframes are nearly the same shape and have similar dimensions.  While the SR-71 holds many records for a manned jet aircraft, the A-12 wflew higher and faster than the its sibling because its existence was classified for over 20 years.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>

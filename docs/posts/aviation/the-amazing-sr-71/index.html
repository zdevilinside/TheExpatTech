      <h2 id="the-blackbird">The Blackbird</h2>
<p>Many people do not know this but there were 2 aircraft named the Blackbird.  The first, the A-12 was built by the CIA, was a single seat reconnaissance airplane.  It was designated the A-12 because it was the 12 in a series of designs for the “Archangel” program.  Archangel was the aircraft’s code name.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Lockheed and Convair were in competition to build a replacement for the U-2.  They were trying to lower the radar cross section of the U-2 because it was so easily detected by the Soviet Union.  At first, the CIA preferred the Convair Kingfisher program but the A-12’s specifications were a little better and its cost was much lower.  Further, the companies track records were a factor; Convair had built the B-58 Hustler that had been plagued by delays and cost overruns.  Lockheed had produced the U-2 on time and under budget.<br>
The A-12 was built between 1962 and 1964.  It flew from 1963 until 1968.  The plane was the precursor to the SR-71 Blackbird, the M-21 launcher for the D-21 drone, and the YF-12 prototype.  Its was originally designed to fly over Cuba and the Soviet Union but that plan was tossed away after Gary Powers was shot down.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The SR-71 was developed as a follow on to the A-12.  It was designed as a 2-seat replacement and flown by the US Air Force.  It was revealed to the public in 1964 and entered service in 1966.  It would fly at Mach 3.2 at 85,000 feet which allowed it to evade or outrace threats.  When a SAM was fired at it, the standard evasive maneuver was to accelerate and outpace the missile.  Over 4,000 SAMs had been fired at Blackbirds throughout its history and not one scored a hit on the plane.  The only time one was damaged during a mission, an A-12 being flown by Dennis Sullivan struck missile debris during a mission on October 30, 1967.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This flight was part of the <strong>Black Shield</strong> missions over North Vietnam.  During Sullivan’s first pass over North Vietnam, Sullivan detected radar tracking of his plane.  Two SAM sites prepared to launch but neither did.  On his 2nd pass, North Vietnam fired at least 6 missiles at the plane.  Each launch was confirmed by vapor trails on mission photography; the pilot saw vapor trails from the SAMs launched at him in photographs.  Sullivan also witnessed 3 missile detonations near and behind the A-12 while it was flying at mach 3.1 at about 84,000 feet.  The damage was found during a post-mission check of the aircraft.</p>

<p>Many say that they SR-71 was retired way too soon.  I happen to agree with them.  I was one of the people in the crowd that saw the SR-71 land at Dulles airport on its last operational flight on its way to the Smithsonian. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>When the SR-71 was retired, it was flown from Edwards Air Force Base to Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C.  It set numerous records during that flight.

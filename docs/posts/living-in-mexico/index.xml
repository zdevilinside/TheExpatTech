<p>So you want to become a resident of Mexico but don&rsquo;t know where to start?  Well, it isn&rsquo;t as easy as just moving to Mexico and you are a resident.  You have to follow specific steps to become one.  If you are thinking of just getting a FMM (AKA Tourist Visa) and live in Mexico on it, those days are rapidly coming to an end.  INM (Mexican Immigration) has now networked their systems so that they can see who is trying to game the system and live in Mexico without follow the legal process.</p>]]></description>

It is that time of the year again where workers are given their yearly bonuses.  This is NOT an optional thing either.  Mexico&rsquo;s previous President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) completely redid the Mexico Ley de Trabajo and this is what it says now:</p>
<p><em>Article 87.- Workers will have the right to an annual bonus that must be paid before the twentieth of December, equivalent to at least fifteen days of salary. Those who have not completed the year of service, regardless of whether they are working or not on the date of settlement of the bonus, will have the right to be paid the proportional part of it, according to the time they have worked, whatever this may be.</em></p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The next morning, I get up, get on my laptop and contact a friend from boarding school that lives in Mexico City.  Pedro gives me some tips for the rest of my trip into Mexico - always tip people 10 pesos or so if they fill your gas tank (Mexico is a &ldquo;full service&rdquo; country where you cannot fill your own gas tank!), and gives us the name of the place to go to exchange our US dollars for pesos.  Dipshit Farmers had gone to Mexico before but they took US dollars and we thought it was that way still.  NOPE!  Mexico implemented new rules that was intended to stop money-laundering.  Anyhow, Pedro tells us to go to a &ldquo;casa de cambio&rdquo; to get that done.  We find one on the map and program it into my wife&rsquo;s GPS.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>We wake up the next morning and it is late - 11 AM or so.  We wanted to sleep and be on the road by 9am but that just didn&rsquo;t happen.  I sneak the cats back into the van and we start on the move once more.</p>
<p>As we are driving away, we noticed that the air conditioneer wasn&rsquo;t blowing cold.  I had just put freon in yesterday before we left Albuquerque!!!!  I decide to go get more freon and put it in in the parking lot by the Motel 6.  When I go to put it in, I noticed my error.  I forgot to put the cap on the line yesterday so all the freon came out!!!  I can be an idiot at times!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Moving to Mexico was a rushed endeavor for us.  We were moving down to Mexico in a used minivan that we bought just for the move.  You cannot rent a U-Haul to move across international borders.  The van we bought has cheap and the plan was to get to Mexico and then just get rid of it.  That turns out not to be something you can do.</p>
<p>To say we were not properly prepared for this move is an understatement of the century.  We were basing things on what we knew about living in the United States, and from our couple of trips to Puerto Penasco, Mexico AKA Rocky Point, or, as my girlfriend at the time kept calling Pina Colada because she was drunk.  Needless to say, things changed!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>I got in my van and drove there! ;)</p>
<p>Okay, I will be serious.  I really didn&rsquo;t have a choice but to move.  In my case, I had just come home from a failed attempt to start school in Germany.  We were in a bad situation - we had sold our house already, needed to move to somewhere for 6 months and live on a student&rsquo;s budget.  We needed to have good Internet, be near a major international airport, and inexpensive.</p>]]></description>

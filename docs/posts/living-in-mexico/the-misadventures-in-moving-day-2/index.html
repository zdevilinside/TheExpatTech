      <p>We wake up the next morning and it is late - 11 AM or so.  We wanted to sleep and be on the road by 9am but that just didn&rsquo;t happen.  I sneak the cats back into the van and we start on the move once more.</p>
<p>As we are driving away, we noticed that the air conditioneer wasn&rsquo;t blowing cold.  I had just put freon in yesterday before we left Albuquerque!!!!  I decide to go get more freon and put it in in the parking lot by the Motel 6.  When I go to put it in, I noticed my error.  I forgot to put the cap on the line yesterday so all the freon came out!!!  I can be an idiot at times!</p>
<p>Once this is done and we get food to continue the journey, we head toward Laredo where we would be crossing into Mexico at Colombia Crossing.  Here I am driving on unfamilar roads with 5 cats meowing non-stop, on the big adventure to move to another country.  Yay! /sarcasm.</p>
<p>When we get to Colombia Crossing, I go in to do the paperwork for our FMM (tourist cards), the Temporary Import Permit for our van, and my wife decides she needs to stay in the van as much as possible to keep the AC on for the cats.  Lines were long and everytime I look out in the parking lot, Angel is driving around it in circles so the AC would run properly and keep the cats safe.  Once I am done getting the temporary import permit, I go to the van and have Angel go in and get her FMM too.  Yes!  We can be on our way now!  WRONG!</p>
<p>As soon as we start to cross into Mexico, we got the &ldquo;red&rdquo; light for further inspection of what we have in our van.  I pull over and they have me get out so they could look inside.  They gaze into the van from the side doors without issue until we get to the back door.  When I start to open it, things start falling out of it as I open the door.  The customs guy laughs as I close the door with my rear end&hellip;.and leave a big dent in the door with my butt.  LOL</p>
<p>They have us go to get the vehicle x-rayed so they can check that way to see if we are not bringing anything into Mexico we shouldn&rsquo;t. I drive other to where the x-ray was supposed to be done, wait a few minutes and nobody was coming.  Did I misunderstand the agent?  I get back into the van and drive back towards the entry point when someone comes running out waving at me to go back.  I do that and wait.  We are told that we need to remove the animals after we drive the van into the scanning area.  I was frustrated at that time, tired, and irritable.  I put all of the cats into a big &ldquo;play pen&rdquo; cat carrier that we had, and carried it all out at once.  Angel, the Mexican border patrol agent, and a few others were laughing at the circus we were putting on.  I don&rsquo;t blame them either.</p>
<p>All is going well, and we are finally cleared to enter Mexico.  YAY!!!!!!!</p>
<p>There is a thing about driving in Mexico.  When you see a semi starts driving on the shoulder of the road, it isn&rsquo;t necessarily they are pulling over.  It often is that they know something is up ahead in the road that needs to be avoided.  I learned this the hard way.  We hit a huge pothole.  DAMN IT!!!!  I pull over and the right front tire is low.  I could see that it had about half the air in it that it should.  FUCK!!!!!  What do I do?  I can either empty the entire van out so I could get to the spare tire, change it, and then reload the van again OR I can drive down until I see a gas station and get the tire changed for me.  YAY!</p>
<p>Well, that was the thought process.  Thought processes can be wrong though but this one was especially so since we were no longer in the US.  As we are driving looking for a service station, people would pull up next to us, drawing a circle and pointing at the tire.  We would shake our heads and wave.  I don&rsquo;t see a gas station or any mechannics along the way.  I keep pulling over to check the tire - it was about half full of air - and keep going.  I really didn&rsquo;t want to change the tire on my own because of having to empty out the cargo area to get to the spare but I finally pull over to do so.  I was so frustrated.</p>
<p>As soon as I pull over and go to look at the tire, I hear a tsk, tsk behind me.  A guy is standing there, looking at the tire, shakes his head and starts walking away.  I realize I am at a tire shop along the side of the road.  There wasn&rsquo;t any signs there about it being a tire shop that I could see, but that is where I stopped!  Good fortune, right?  I call out to the guy with my pigeon Spanish asking about &ldquo;air&rdquo; so we can just air up the tire and get back on our way.  The guy coms over with a air gun and starts putting air in the tire.  As the tire inflates again, we hear a whooshing sound from the other side of the tire.  The guy smiles, puts up his index finger, and gestures for me to wait.  He comes back with a floor jack, and jacks up the van, and takes off the tire.</p>
<p>Once the tire is flat on the ground, you can see a huge dent in the rim.  The guy grabs a piece of wood and immediately hammers the dent as flat as he can.  He then airs up the tire and it is ALMOST back to normal - about 80% full before it starts to deflate.  Hell, I will go on with that!</p>
<p>I ask him how much I owe him in Spanish &ldquo;Cuoto de debo?&rdquo;  The guy shakes his head and smiles.  I insist I pay him something for his efforts.  Finally, he signals me to follow him into the shop.  Once we get inside, he reaches in and grabs a Coke and gestures for me to do the same.  I get a bottle of water.  He charges me for both drinks and when I try to pay him more, he shakes his head and points out the door.  Holy hell!  I just got my tire &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; for about $2.  My wife is dumbfounded when I tell her but we are on our way again!</p>
<p>We drive down the cuota (what Mexico calls their toll roads) and get to Monterey.  I want to turn off the road into Monterey and continue to Saltilo but I forget to tell my wife about the idea.  She freaks out and we get in an argument about my getting us &ldquo;lost&rdquo;.  We drive around Monterrey for awhile and after 2 hours finally arrive at a hotel.  We watched 2 couples before us talking at the check-in desk turn around shaking their heads as they walk away.  Don&rsquo;t tell me that the only hotel we found in 2 hours of looking had no vacancy, PLEASE!  Turns out that wasn&rsquo;t the case.  They didn&rsquo;t like the price for the night that was quoted.  We were so tired that we didn&rsquo;t care.  We checked in, went to the room, and I carry all 5 cats in the playpen into the room as they meowed non-stop.</p>
<p>The adventure continues the next day.</p>

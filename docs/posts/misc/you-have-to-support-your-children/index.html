    <div class="content">
      <p>I am going to write this as a narrative as I found about it.</p>
<p>I was at a friend&rsquo;s house on October 3, 2025 when she asked me if I had a picture of my son.  I told her I didn&rsquo;t have one on me but explained that I know his work&rsquo;s website had one on there.  I proceeded to go there on my phone and found my son&rsquo;s section on it.  There was a big problem though - it was a different name with my son&rsquo;s photo.</p>
<p>I read the bio and it listed my son as a trans-woman and so much more.  I was floored and when I was driving home, I called my wife to tell her about what I saw.  We thought it was one of 2 things - he is using it as a marketing ploy for his counseling work OR that he was really transgender.</p>
<p>As soon as I got home, I sent an email to him saying that I love him no matter what and I was supporting of them.  You have to love your children, and it is their life to live.  Your beliefs about something like this isn&rsquo;t necessarily your beliefs and there is nowhere in the Constitution that gives you the right to force your beliefs upon someone else.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the next day, my son posted on his Facebook that he was a transwoman and her name is now going to be Mika.  My sister posted something really negative about it almost immediately.  The next business day, my Mom (his grandma) sent him a box with nothing but junk mail in it, addressed to his previous name with &ldquo;Mika&rdquo; in the middle between his first and last name.  This lady always claims she is broke, cannot afford anything, claims is a liberal, progressive but this is what she did to her own blood.  They say the message is in the form of the medium used.  We figured out that she is a liberal to everyone but her own family.</p>
<p>Anyhow, my daughter knows how I am handling things and is okay with it.  Before I was told by her about her transitioning, I refer to her by her boy&rsquo;s name and &ldquo;him&rdquo;.  Afterwards, I refer to her as &ldquo;Mika&rdquo; and &ldquo;she&rdquo;.  I also pointed out to her that I am going to have a hard time for awhile getting those things straight because it was something I had been doing for so long - calling her by her birth name and &ldquo;he&rdquo;.  She said she understands fully and won&rsquo;t hold it against me.  I am grateful for that.</p>
<p>Anyhow, there is a famous saying that &ldquo;blood is thicker than water&rdquo;.  I support my daughter no matter what her choices are in life.</p>

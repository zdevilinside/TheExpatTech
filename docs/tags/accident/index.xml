      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;disaster-strikes&#34;&gt;Disaster Strikes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some names have been changed to protect both the innocent and the guilty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-fall&#34;&gt;The Fall&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A major snowstorm hit northern New Mexico in February. Government offices and schools closed everywhere—except at the Lab. We were given only a two‑hour delay. I went to my old office in the Ad Building to retrieve information my team lead, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, insisted only I had.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After passing through the booth and going “behind the fence,” I found the parking lot coated in solid ice. Wearing YakTrax, I shuffled carefully in a “penguin walk.” Even so, I slipped and fell hard. My left leg and right arm were trapped beneath me: I dislocated my left ankle, breaking both the tibia and fibula, and fractured my right radial head (elbow).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;disaster-day-2&#34;&gt;Disaster, Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After my accident, it was clear I had nowhere practical to recover. I would be in a wheelchair for months, yet my home was a 50‑year‑old duplex with all the bathrooms upstairs and the kitchen downstairs. That setup was impossible. The decision was made: I would be flown to Las Cruces, NM, where I could undergo surgery and rehabilitation in a more suitable environment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drugged‑up me, ever the private pilot and veteran OV‑1 Mohawk pilot from my Army days, thought: &lt;em&gt;“Cool, I’ll get flown down in a Cessna 182 or maybe a Cessna 337. I’ll even ask to take the controls for a bit since I’m licensed and familiar with the type.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Reality check: nope. First, I couldn’t work the rudder; second, I was so drugged up they wouldn’t have let me near the controls even if I could.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

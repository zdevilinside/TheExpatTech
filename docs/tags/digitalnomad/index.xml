      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are feeling wunderlust.  Your job is online so you feel that you can start working from anywhere.  You decide to give it a go.  You look online at the rules needed to travel the world while working online.  That is how you get your start.  This site will explain &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; path down this rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my case, it came about as a necessity.  I was on my way to graduate school in Germany when that was cut short due to illness.  I looked around and did research online for the best places to go and live for 6 months before I gave another shot at going to Germany.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;well-what-is-this-site&#34;&gt;Well, what is this site?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to create a place where I can share the things I enjoy, the things I know well, and the things I’ve spent a lifetime immersed in. I know a lot about computers. I’m an American who lives part-time in Mexico, part-time in the U.S., and part-time all over the world. I’ve worked professionally as an IT technician for over three decades. I also know quite a bit about how to entertain yourself if you&amp;rsquo;re an indoor person who likes movies and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was on my way to graduate school in Germany back in 2015.  I got as far as Amsterdam when I ended up being hospitalized for 15 days.  7 days in was when graduate school started.  The Germans wouldn&amp;rsquo;t let me have a late start so I had to return to the US.  We had already sold our house by then so I needed to move somewhere fast.  My requirements were that the place was inexpensive, had great internet service, was near a major international airport, and that &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;snow&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; was a foreign language and the only ice you got was in your drink.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;happy-thanksgiving&#34;&gt;Happy Thanksgiving!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And while we celebrate with family, food, and traditions, here’s a fun piece of trivia about the star of the meal—the turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-mexican-roots-of-the-turkey&#34;&gt;The Mexican Roots of the Turkey&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did you know the turkey is actually &lt;strong&gt;Mexican&lt;/strong&gt;? Long before it became the centerpiece of American Thanksgiving, the &lt;strong&gt;Aztecs domesticated the bird over 2,000 years ago&lt;/strong&gt;. They called it the &lt;em&gt;huexolotl&lt;/em&gt; and considered it sacred.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-parents-journey&#34;&gt;A Parent’s Journey&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to share this story as it unfolded for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On October 3, 2025, I was at a friend’s house when she asked if I had a picture of my son. I didn’t have one with me, but I knew his workplace website had a photo. Pulling it up on my phone, I found his section—only to see his photo under a different name.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reading the bio, I discovered that my son was listed as a &lt;strong&gt;trans woman&lt;/strong&gt;. I was floored. Driving home, I called my wife to tell her what I had seen. We thought it could be one of two things: either a marketing angle for his counseling work, or that he was truly transgender.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

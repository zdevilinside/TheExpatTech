      <description>&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine had his Flipper Zero freeze up on them.  They asked me how to get it to reset.  When that didn&amp;rsquo;t work, they decided to do a &amp;ldquo;hard reset&amp;rdquo; of their Flipper but they had difficulty finding the directions on how to do it.  I decided to create this page to help those that are having to look online to find the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do you have a Flipper Zero that you forgot the pin to?  It is actually quite easy to reset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am going to write this as a narrative as I found about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was at a friend&amp;rsquo;s house on October 3, 2025 when she asked me if I had a picture of my son.  I told her I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one on me but explained that I know his work&amp;rsquo;s website had one on there.  I proceeded to go there on my phone and found my son&amp;rsquo;s section on it.  There was a big problem though - it was a different name with my son&amp;rsquo;s photo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

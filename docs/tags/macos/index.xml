      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to create a MacOS 15 Sequoia VM in VMware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have noticed that a lot of people seem to have bought into the marketing of Apple and believe that the Mac is the best computer. Apple has won the marketing game just like Bose has done with speakers. Audiophiles say that if you want no highs or lows, you buy Bose!  Most people just don&amp;rsquo;t seem to get that while Apple does provide a good product, they are overpriced for what they provide and it isn&amp;rsquo;t close to the value most Windows-based computers are. Yes, you can find value with Linux but most people are more comfortable with what they already have been using for years &amp;ndash; Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

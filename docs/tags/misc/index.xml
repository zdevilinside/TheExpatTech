      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I want to share a fun piece of trivia.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the &amp;ldquo;star&amp;rdquo; of Thanksgiving dinner, the turkey, is actually Mexican? If you think the turkey is American, you’re mistaken. The turkey is an immigrant. Mexico&amp;rsquo;s Aztecs domesticated the turkey over 2,000 years ago. It was called the huexolotl. They didn’t eat it the way we do today—with gravy and stuffing. The Aztecs ate it with mole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am going to write this as a narrative as I found about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was at a friend&amp;rsquo;s house on October 3, 2025 when she asked me if I had a picture of my son.  I told her I didn&amp;rsquo;t have one on me but explained that I know his work&amp;rsquo;s website had one on there.  I proceeded to go there on my phone and found my son&amp;rsquo;s section on it.  There was a big problem though - it was a different name with my son&amp;rsquo;s photo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

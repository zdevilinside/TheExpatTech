I was on my way to graduate school in Germany back in 2015.  I got as far as Amsterdam when I ended up being hospitalized for 15 days.  7 days in was when graduate school started.  The Germans wouldn't let me have a late start so I had to return to the US.  We had already sold our house by then so I needed to move somewhere fast.  My requirements were that the place was inexpensive, had great internet service, was near a major international airport, and that "*snow*" was a foreign language and the only ice you got was in your drink.
